Can you create a website like Low-tech Magazine and then hop on a plane
to visit your family for Christmas? I don't think so. This year my
girlfriend and I will travel from Barcelona to Brussels by train. An
expensive business.

How can you blame people for flying if there is no affordable
alternative?

A plane ticket would have cost us 250 euro (\$320), both ways, two
persons. The train ticket costs 560 euro (\$720), or more than double
the fare of a plane ticket (352 euro Barcelona-Paris, 208 euro
Paris-Brussels).

Mind you, it is not the only price I have to pay. My family, my friends
and my girlfriend all think I'm nuts. They know me as the guy always
short on cash.

Travel time

The travel time for the plane trip is 4 hours (one way, including
airport transit time), while travel time on the train is 15.5 hours (12
hours Barcelona-Paris, 1.5 hours Paris-Brussels, and at least 2 hours of
waiting and travelling between two trains that arrive and leave at
different stations).

More than double the price for almost quadruple the travel time. I
expect to meet a lot of hardcore environmentalists on that train (not to
mention all the technophobes afraid of flying). What other incentive is
there to choose a means of transport that is both slower and more
expensive?

High-speed train

We could have cut the travel time in half if we had chosen a high-speed
train from Barcelona to Paris. However, that would more than double the
price on that section.

The reason why the train ticket between Paris and Brussels (600
kilometres or 370 miles both ways, 208 euro) is relatively more
expensive than that between Barcelona and Paris (2,250 kilometres or
1,400 miles both ways, 352 euro) is because on this section of the trip
we had [no other
choice]({filename}/posts/high-speed-trains-are-killing-the-european-railway-network.md)
than to board a high-speed train. Slower trains on this route have been
abolished. We could have taken the bus, but then we wouldn't make it on
time for Christmas dinner.

Blame

How can you blame people for flying if there is no affordable
alternative?

Of course, we will take the opportunity to spend one long and romantic
night in Paris. It makes the trip even longer and more expensive, but to
hell with that. You only live once. From Low-tech Magazine, *Joyeux Noël
et Bonne Année* !
