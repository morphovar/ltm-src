Drinking bottled water is a much more ecological choice than consuming
soft drinks, coffee, fruit juice or beer. Water drinkers should be
praised instead of criticized.

Bottled water is under attack from environmentalists who preach that tap
water has a similar quality and saves a lot of energy since it does not
need to be transported by trucks. That might be true, but bottled water
is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits.

All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during
their production processes, which makes their ecological impact far more
detrimental than that of bottled water. Like bottled water, most of them
are distributed in bottles and cans, too. *(Illustration:

The new smokers

Bottled water has become one of the most powerful symbols of
unsustainable practices. Giles Coren, an English food journalist, has
coined bottled water drinkers “the new smokers”.

These fierce criticisms are understandable. After all, most western
countries have good quality tap water, which makes bottled water (often
from the same water sources) a bit of an absurdity. But, denouncing
bottled water misses the point.

Indeed, trucking around tap water in plastic bottles creates unnecessary
energy use and waste. However, so does trucking around Coca-Cola, Stella
Artois and Chivas Regal. It is unfair to solely blame water even though
it also happens to be distributed via pipes.

More importantly, all other beverages use vast amounts of water and
energy to produce, while water - even bottled water - does not. It takes
water to grow crops, and it takes energy to fertilize, harvest and
transport them.

Breweries use water and energy too. It takes 35 litres of water to
produce one cup of tea, and 140 litres of water to produce one cup of
coffee. When you add sugar in your coffee or tea, it gets even worse:
every teaspoonful of sugar requires 50 cups of water to grow.

A glass of beer takes 75 litres of water to produce, while just one
glass of wine asks 120 litres of water. One glass of fruit juice or milk
requires 170 to 200 litres of water. A glass of brandy asks 2,400 litres
of water *(all numbers taken from

Tea and coffee

Producing one litre of bottled water simply requires a litre of water,
and no energy. Yes, producing and distributing the water bottles *does*
use water and energy, but the same goes for other beverages.

This means that bottled water is a more ecological choice than all other
bottled options: beer, wine, milk, fruit juice or soft drinks. Most
likely, drinking bottled water is an even better choice than drinking
coffee or tea made with tap water - coffee and tea might weigh less than
water, but they are transported over much larger distances.

The only undisputable better choice than bottled water is tap water.
Forcing bottled water drinkers to drink tap water would help the
environment – but switching from other beverages (none of them essential
to human health) to bottled water would yield much more environmental
profit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental groups always have something to say about the huge (and
growing) amounts of bottled water that are being sold, and the huge
amount of energy that is needed to transport them. These figures might
be accurate, but bottled water holds only a small share of the market
for bottled drinks.

The energy needed to transport soft drinks and beer is far more
impressive. The main problem here is not bottled water. The main problem
is that most people *don’t* drink water, but prefer soft drinks, fruit
juice, coffee, beer or energy drinks instead.

This message, however, is not so popular because most of us like to
discuss the environmental problems of this planet over a couple of
beers, or wines, or coffees.

Pariahs

Don’t get me wrong. This is not a plea for everyone to start drinking
bottled water instead of tap water. Drinking tap water should be
encouraged. But people who prefer to drink bottled water should not be
treated as pariahs, because they are making a much more ecological
choice than those of us who choose to consume other beverages.
