The high energy consumption of the mobile phone network is mainly due to
the limited life span of the phones.

This week, more than 50,000 people gather in Barcelona for the ‘[Mobile
World Congress](http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/)’, the annual high
mass for the mobile telephone. They gape in admiration at the newest
generation of gadgets, which is again fitted with new applications and
new designs. This almost unanimously praised innovation, however, has a
dark side. Around half of the energy use of the mobile phone network is
attributed to the production of the phones.

The mobile phone is a success story without equal. A good 15 years after
the birth of the mobile network, almost half of the world population
(2.7 billion people) owns a mobile phone. That does not mean that during
this time only 2.7 billion phones were produced – it’s a multiple of
that amount.

In 2007 alone, 1.16 billion phones were sold, a large amount of them
replacement purchases. In principle, a mobile phone can be used ten
years or longer. But there are dozens of reasons to replace the
appliance much earlier.  
  
Camera, touch screen, GPS and internet

At first, mobiles were being replaced because they became smaller and
because they weighed less – a feature that improves portability. Next,
the cellular phone with built-in camera arrived on the market,
accompanied by a colour screen. These cameras get more pixels each year,
another reason to buy a new phone.

In the meantime, the devices got more memory, the screen got bigger and
the telephones were equipped with a folding keyboard that makes sending
text messages easier. Following that came machines with a built-in
mp3-player.

corresponds to the energy use of driving a car for 200 kilometres or  
125 miles"

Recent improvements are phones with a touch screen, phones with a
built-in GPS, and phones with an internet connection. Especially the
last application is (in combination with faster 3G networks like UMTS)
being seen as the promise for the near future: a little bit more
patience and we will all be sending emails, surfing the internet,
downloading music, watching television and playing online games via the
mobile phone.

Apart from these technical improvements, the mobile phone is also a
fashion object and a status symbol – in itself reason enough to replace
it regularly. The consequence of all this is that a mobile phone on
average does not last even two years. Mostly the machine is replaced
when the battery gives up.

Manufacture of the phone  

That means that every one of us will acquire around [35 mobile
phones](http://www.weeeman.org/html/impact/facts.html) during his or her
lifetime. From an environmental perspective, the [production of all
those
machines]({filename}/posts/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.md)
outweighs the energy use of the phone itself.

According to a [life cycle
analysis](http://www.weeeman.org/html/what/lifecycle_case.html) carried
out by order of Nokia, 70 percent of the total energy use of a mobile
telephone takes place during the production phase: the mining of the
[resources](http://www.notechmagazine.com/resources/), the production of
the components, the assembling of the machine and finally the transport
of resources, components and finished products. Charging the phone only
takes up 30 percent of its total energy use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>

"70 to 95 percent of the total energy use of a mobile telephone takes
place during the production phase"

</div>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

The amount of energy used is not small: during its lifetime a mobile
phone equals an average energy consumption of 260 megajoules (MJ) – 180
MJ for the manufacturing and 80 MJ for the usage phase. 260 MJ is enough
to power 1,200 60 watt light bulbs for one hour.

Multiply that by 35 (the amount of phones during one’s lifetime) and
then by 2.7 billion (the amount of people that can afford a mobile
nowadays) and it becomes clear that progress has a price. In addition,
more than 90 percent of waste is also generated during the production
phase.

A landline phone consumes much less electricity than a mobile phone (in
fact it gets powered by the switchboard via the copper cable) and it
lasts much longer – at least, that was the case until the arrival of the
mobile, because since then also fixed phones changed into mobile,
fashionable appliances.

Telephone infrastructure  

The mobile telephone infrastructure also consumes more energy than the
fixed phone infrastructure. According to a Swiss
[study](http://www.esu-services.ch/download/faist-2005-umts.pdf) dating
from December 2004, transmitting information over a mobile network costs
3 times more energy than over a fixed network (including the extra
copper and fibre glass used by the fixed phone network).

The switch from GSM to networks of the third generation (like UMTS) will
propel energy use even further. These networks need 50 percent more base
stations which consume four times more energy.

Thanks to the faster data transfer, the UMTS network on itself is
nevertheless more energy efficient. The transfer of one gigabit of
information (around 500 minutes of calls) via the GSM network
corresponds to the energy use of driving a car for 220 kilometres, for
the UMTS-network this is ‘just’ 150 kilometres.

However, since the UMTS-network will pave the way for all kinds of new
applications (like the transmission of music and film), the data
transfer per user will increase substantially. The scientists calculated
that the UMTS-network will eventually consume 2.4 times more energy than
the GSM-network.

Life span  

Even if the energy consumption of the total phone network is considered,
the production phase of the phones remains decisive (around 50 percent
of energy use). There are many more telephones than base stations and
the network infrastructure lasts on average 8 times longer than the
phones.

The researchers conclude that extending the life span of the phones from
one to four years would lower the ecological impact of the complete
telephone infrastructure by 40 percent. According to the Swiss, charging
a mobile only makes up 5 to 15 percent of its total energy consumption.

"If you want to make an ecological choice, there is only one option:
keep your mobile as long as possible, and turn your back on all
novelties"

</div>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

The (little) efforts of the manufacturers to green their gadgets are
mostly aimed at reducing the energy consumption during the use phase. If
we want to contain the energy use of the phone network, it is however
much more effective to lengthen the life span of the mobiles.
Furthermore, the increased energy efficiency is always again cancelled
out by extra applications that consume more energy.

Even mobile phones that are being recharged [by means of solar panels or
a hand
crank]({filename}/posts/wind-up-your-la.md) do
not have much influence on the ecological damage of the technology.
Neither do phones that are easier to recycle, because as mentioned
earlier 90 percent of the waste is generated during the
[production]({filename}/posts/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.md).
The (indeed huge) amount of e-waste is therefore only the tip of the
iceberg.

If you want to make an ecological choice, there is only one option: keep
your mobile as long as possible, and turn your back on all novelties - a
message that will not be heard on the Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona.
