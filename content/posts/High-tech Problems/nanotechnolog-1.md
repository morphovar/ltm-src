What will remain of greentech, cleantech and ecotech if nanotechnology
turns out to be harmful for humans and the environment?

It’s hard to keep track of the soon-to-be-implemented technological
solutions that will solve our energy and environmental woes by means of
nanotechnology – the science of manipulating individual atoms. Solar
panels and batteries might be far from optimal solutions now, but
nanomaterials will boost their efficiency and dramatically lower their
costs. Transporting electricity from solar plants in deserts may not be
possible yet, but nanotechnology will bring us cheap superconducting
cables and efficient hydrogen storage. Unfortunately, more and more
research indicates that nanomaterials might become a severe health
problem and an environmental nightmare.

Many key technologies of the coming ecotech revolution - the belief that
technology can solve the looming energy crisis without giving up our
high energy consumption - are evolving at a provocatively slow rate.
Batteries are an indispensable element of electric cars, but their
capacity is limited: if we want to give e-cars the same mileage as
gasoline powered cars, the batteries would be bigger than the cars
themselves. Even then, it would take several hours to recharge them, and
since batteries lose their recharging capacity over time they have to be
replaced after some years - making electric cars [everything but
green]({filename}/posts/bumper-cars-o-1.md).

Slow progress

Solar energy is far from perfect, either. Current efficiencies of solar
panels make the environmental benefits [doubtful in less sunny
regions]({filename}/posts/the-ugly-side-o.md).
With an average increase in efficiency of 0.5 percent a year, it would
take a few more decennia before solar panels can play a significant role
in energy production. Locating solar panels or solar thermal plants
(which have a much better efficiency and are less energy-intensive to
manufacture) in deserts does not really solve that problem, because in
this case the question arises of how to transport the generated
electricity to our cities (unless we move our cities to the desert).

Hydrogen is not an option at the moment. Over a distance of 3,000
kilometres (from the Sahara to Western Europe), 75 percent of the
electricity produced to make hydrogen would get lost by the involved
conversion, transport and storage process
([source](http://www.trec-uk.org.uk/reports/TRANS-CSP_Full_Report_Final.pdf),
see page 13, figure 1-1). Superconducting power lines are the only
solution with affordable losses, yet they are way too expensive.



Nanotech revolution

Ecotech boffins are convinced that this slow progress can be accelerated
in a spectacular way. But, if one reads the news articles and press
releases that promise a breathtaking advance in
[superconducters](http://www.physorg.com/news63109068.html),

or [fuel cells](http://www.physorg.com/news125836368.html) (which can
store hydrogen), one finds that all these claims rely on the same
technology: manipulating individual atoms, a method known as
[nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology). All
obstacles seem to disappear when 'nano-engineered titanate',
'[buckyballs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene)' and (especially)
'[carbon nanotubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotubes)' are
put to use.

This does not apply solely to:

    : *"nanosafe's Li-ion cells using nano titanate structures instead

    incredible 250-mile range, a full recharge time of only 10 minutes,

A match made in heaven?

In fact, nanotech and ecotech have almost become synonyms. According to
the British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA),
nanotechnology could [help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20
percent](http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/10905) by 2050, with similar
reductions in air pollution. Treehugger, one of the most influential
eco-magazines on the internet, dubbed the combination environment -
nanotechnology a "[match made in
heaven](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/05/nanotech_environment.php)".



Nanotech in the 19th century

History shows that it might be wise to be sceptical of enthusiastic
claims. Especially relevant for nanotechnology is the case of asbestos.
Starting at the end of the 19th century, asbestos was seen as a
revolutionary material due to its versatility, strength, resistance to
fire and heat resistance. It soon became widespread in all kinds of
building materials and consumer products. Browsing through news articles
from those days, one seems to be reading present press releases on
nanotechnology. Take this [excerpt from the New York Times, for example,
dated November 21,
1909](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C00E3DC143EE033A25752C2A9679D946897D6CF):

> *"Of all the queer materials which nature seems to have provided for
> no other purpose than that man may show his ingenuity in their use,
> nothing compares to that mineralogical vegetable, asbestos, which in
> its native state is both fibrous and crystalline, elastic and yet
> brittle, a stone, which will float, and which may be carded, spun, and
> woven like flax or silk. (...). It is absolutely indestructible, no
> known combination of acids, even, affecting the strength of appearance
> of its fibre, and the fiercest flames leaving it unscathed. (...).
> Millions of feet of steam pipes, boilers, are covered with asbestos,
> which causes them to retain all heat, while the same material forms a
> frost-proof protection for gas and water pipes."*

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
   
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the 1970s, it became clear that prolonged inhalation of asbestos
fibres can result in lung diseases like asbestosis or mesothelioma, a
rapidly fatal form of lung cancer. Asbestos was banned at the end of the
1980s. Today, there are thousands of companies making a good profit on
removing this once revolutionary material out of buildings, machinery
and infrastructure. The cost of asbestos-related disease is expected to
exceed 200 billion dollar in the US alone.

Health effects

With this experience in mind, one would assume that today we would
investigate the possible harmful effects of new "magical" materials
before we implement them. However, this is not the case. At this very
moment, there are already more than 600 (identified) consumer products
on the market that contain nanomaterials (find a continually updated
list [here](http://www.nanotechproject.org/consumerproducts)). None of
them have been tested for possible negative effects on the environment
or on our health, for the simple reason that there are no tests
available yet.

Billions of dollars are pumped into nanotech research each year, yet
there is hardly any money available for investigating the risks of it
(in the US, less than 3 percent of the 1.4 billion dollar federal
nanotechnology budget was spent on risk research). Nanoscale silver is
the most cited nanomaterial used in the products already on the market
(20 percent), followed by carbon (including carbon nanotubes and
buckyballs).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a solution to our energy and environmental woes, "nanostructured
bismuth telluride bulk alloys" sounds way better than "say goodbye to
cars, plane trips and mobile phones"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advocates of nanotechnology say that nanomaterials are [unlikely to be
dangerous](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/02/environment_hea_1.php),
because our world is already full of them, in the form of dust, smoke,
sand or sea spray. That might sound reassuring, but it's not. Firstly,
inhaling dust or smoke can be harmful. Secondly, proponents of
nanotechnology solely talk about the chemical properties of
nanomaterials: carbon is harmless for people, they reason, and therefore
carbon nanotubes are harmless, too. Yet, nanomaterials can not be
treated as chemicals. The structure of nanomaterials is as important as
their chemical properties in defining the health and environmental
effects. Asbestos comes in different shapes and sizes, and some of them
are much more harmful than others.

Asbestos

At the end of last year, in the journal Nature, [13 nanotoxicity experts
called for more research into the potential toxicity of
nanoparticles](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/full/444267a.html)
:

> *"Recent studies examining the toxicity of engineered nanomaterials in
> cell cultures and animals have shown that size, surface area, surface
> chemistry, solubility and possibly shape all play a role in
> determining the potential for engineered nanomaterials to cause
> harm."*
>
> *"This is not surprising: we have known for many years that inhaled
> dusts cause disease, and that their harmfulness depends on both what
> they are made of and their physical nature. For instance, small
> particles of inhaled quartz lead to lung damage and the potential
> development of progressive lung disease, yet the same particles with a
> thin coating of clay are less harmful."*
>
> *"Asbestos presents a far more dramatic example: thin, long fibres of
> the material can lead to lung disease if inhaled, but grind the fibres
> down to shorter particles with the same chemical make-up and the
> harmfulness is significantly reduced."*

Carbon nanotubes

Carbon nanotubes - the poster child of the nanotech revolution - look
very much like asbestos fibres (it's also interesting to note that one
of the nanoproducts already on the market is [fireproof
glass](http://www.azonano.com/news.asp?newsID=1443) - resistance to fire
was the main use of asbestos).

A study that was released yesterday, and will be published in Nature
Nanotechnology, showed that [carbon nanotubes that look like asbestos
fibres, also behave like asbestos
fibres](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/poen-cnt051908.php).
In other words, the wonder material of the 21st century turns out to be
carcinogenic. (see also news articles
[here](http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=carbon-nanotube-danger),
[here](http://gizmodo.com/392166/are-nanotubes-the-new-asbestos) and
[here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/20/AR2008052001331.html?hpid=moreheadlines)).

Just as is the case with asbestos, the dangers of carbon nanotubes do
not necessarily appear when the technology is in use. Insulation that
contains asbestos does not harm people as long as it's captured in or
between other materials.

Only during manufacture and removal - when the fibres can be released in
the air or in the water - asbestos can be deadly (there are exceptions,
however, like the use of asbestos in brakes). That means that discarded
nanoproducts have to be treated as toxic waste, and that workers
producing nanoproducts have to be protected. Today, that is not the
case. Andrew Maynard, the author of the study that appeared yesterday,
[said last year in an
interview](http://www.nanotechproject.org/news/archive/us_government_delays_nanotechnology/):

> *"The materials safety data sheet for carbon nanotubes - which
> provides workers and safety personel with information on proper
> handling procedures - treats these substances as graphite, the
> material used in pencils. But carbon nanotubes are as similar to
> pencil lead as the soot on my BBQ is to diamonds."*

Toxic socks

The risks of nanotechnology are not limited to carbon nanotubes. In
April, an American study showed that [socks containing nanomaterials (to
prevent foot-odour) pose a threat to marine
organisms](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-04/acs-cra031008.php).
The socks hold nanoparticle silver, which is the most used element in
today's commercially available nanoproducts for its antibacterial and
odour-fighting properties. The researchers simply washed the socks and
found that some of them released substantial amounts of nanosilver
particles during laundry, which then travel through wastewater treatment
systems and into natural waterways, where they can kill fish.

This also means, incidentally, that the socks lose their magical
properties after one or several washes and that you will smell his feet
again. In December 2007, it was also found that [C60 nanoparticles
(Buckyballs) are toxic for aquatic
species](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6T4G-4R8HHNJ-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c1556b50539e46f787d9ae55eed0cd91).
Conclusion: the three most promising nanomaterials have side effects
that make them everything but green. Of course, none of these worrying
studies were published on ecotech websites (some even choose to publish
[another hurrah-article on
nanotech](http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1655/) today).

Look the other way

It is tempting to close our eyes for these risks, since the trouble will
only appear in the far future, as was the case with asbestos:
mesothelomia takes 30 to 40 years to appear following exposure. And
nanotechnology is an attractive solution, since it would allow us to
keep living our high energy consumption lifestyle. As a solution to our
energy and environmental woes, "nanostructured bismuth telluride bulk
alloys" sounds way better than "say goodbye to cars, plane trips and
mobile phones".

One could argue that the worrying results do not mean that
nanotechnology (or ecotech) is dead: the research in Nature
Nanotechnology also showed that shorter nanotubes don't seem to be
causing trouble. Yet, engineered nanomaterials come in such an enormous
diversity of sizes, shapes, compositions and coatings, that there is an
awful lot of testing to be done. That will surely slow down progress in
nanotechnology, and make the products more expensive. Unless we decide
not to do the testing, of course.
