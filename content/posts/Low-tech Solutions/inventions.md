Magazine](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/site-map.html) will take some
time off during summer, but this does not mean we will leave you without
anything to read. The online archives of [Invention & Technology
Magazine](http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/)
(1985-2007) should keep you busy for quite some time (thanks a lot for
the tip, [David](http://tapwaterj.stumbleupon.com/)). This spin-off of
American Heritage Magazine is dedicated to the history of technology.
Very recommended.

Update December 2011: the archives have vanished.
