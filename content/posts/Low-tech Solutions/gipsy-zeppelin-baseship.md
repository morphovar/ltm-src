The gipsy zeppelin baseship of Lieven Standaert generates its own
energy, never has to land, and is equipped with a sun terrace where you
can have a coffee.

Airships have received a lot of attention in recent years, for both the
transport of [passengers and
goods]({filename}/posts/green-slow-air.md). They
are more economical and silent than airplanes, and they are still
considerably faster than most means of transportation over land or
water. That said, zeppelins are faced with some problems.

To stay afloat they use helium, a non-renewable gas becoming scarce.
Moreover, because of their round shape and insignificant weight they are
hard to manage when they are on the ground. They also need a significant
amount of parking space, making the hangars more expensive than the
airships themselves.



Lieven Standaert, a Belgian engineer, architect and science teacher,
plans to build a zeppelin that holds none of those disadvantages. His
[Aeromodeller II](http://www.aeromodeller2.be/) is inspired by the
[zeppelin of the same
name](http://randomknowledge.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/aeromodeller.jpg)
built in 1970 by his compatriot, the legendary artist Panamarenko.

Panamarenko is devoted to building fantastic flying machines that have
never flown (although he maintains that they do). Lieven Standaert, on
the other hand, is determined to actually fly his dream machine. An
exhibition currently running in Antwerp is largely dedicated to the
low-tech and low-cost techniques to develop this "yacht of the 21st
century".

Enjoy the view

The Aeromodeller II floats not on helium but on hydrogen, which has a
dual function as fuel for the engines. The hydrogen is generated on
board, while the ship hovers in the air and drops anchor at a height of
50 to 100 metres. This happens by means of a cable, similar to that of a
kite.



The zeppelin inverts its propellers, which then serve as
[windmills]({filename}/posts/floating-windmi.md).
They deliver the necessary energy to split water (coming from the
ballast tanks and replenished by rain) into hydrogen and oxygen. Six
hours of wind energy accumulate enough fuel for one hour of flying.

This means that the airship has to “rest” regularly to charge its
“batteries” – just like a living creature. This would be the perfect
moment to slide open the large windows, take a seat on the terrace and
enjoy the sun and the view.

Worldwide autonomy

Standaert’s solution to the ground manageability problem and the need
for a specially designed airport and energy infrastructure is rather
radical: he wants to keep his zeppelin in the air. Because the
Aeromodeller II generates its own energy, it never has to land.



This implies that the airship should be regarded as a houseboat or stray
ship and not as an alternative to a scheduled flight. The Aeromodeller
II is designed for stability and not for
[speed](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/speed/). While other airships can
attain speeds of up to 150 km/h (93mph), the Aeromodeller with its two
70 kilowatt engines will only reach speeds of about 80 km/h (50mph).

Yacht

Lieven Standaert: "Airships are slow. You don’t design a good vehicle
starting from its weaknesses. Forget speed. This thing can never be a
good speedboat. It is a sailing ship. Make it storm proof. Make it
seaworthy. We love sailing ships, not for their speed or efficiency, but
because of the way of travelling. A zeppelin can be worthwhile in a
similar fashion. You can get on board with a backpack full of biscuits
and canned soup and just take off, without the need for petrol stations
or anything. You can re-appear two years later, coming from the other
direction..."

Hydrogen flagship

Floating around in a zeppelin for a couple of years will not appeal to
everybody, whether the airship has a sun terrace or not. What Standaert
desires to accomplish with his project is to promote hydrogen as a clean
fuel. A zeppelin is better suited for that than a car:



"Cars are not the best vehicle to demonstrate the potential of hydrogen.
BMW has a car on display in Brussels that drives on hydrogen. But as
long as we have not 1,000 hydrogen stations across Europe this car
cannot drive anywhere. And these hydrogen stations will only appear when
everybody is convinced that hydrogen is the best substitute to
gasoline."

"My airship has to become a symbol, a flagship for cleaner energy
technology. Because it generates its own energy, it needs no new energy
infrastructure. Because it does this by means of wind energy, it is a
real zero-emission vehicle. And the space required for the storage of
hydrogen, the most important practical problem for the use of hydrogen
in cars, is not a problem in a zeppelin of 85 meters either."

Historical trauma

Hydrogen and airships are not a self-evident combination. Lieven
Standaert: “Zeppelins bear a historical trauma. In 1937 the Hindenburg
burned down and since then all airships are filled with non flammable
helium. But, if we can develop safe hydrogen cars, we can develop safe
hydrogen zeppelins. There are still engineers speculating on how the
fire started in the Hindenburg. Don’t speculate, perform the tests.”



“Nobody has published anything on experiments with hydrogen balloons in
the last 50 years. Adisson Bain, a NASA-engineer, is one of the
authorities on the Hindenburg disaster. His experiments consist of fire
experiments on pieces of skin measuring 10 by 10 centimetres. But there
is no way you can scale down fire experiments like that, a match does
not burn in a similar fashion as a forest. I have done these experiments
on a reasonable scale, and the results have convinced me that I can
build a safe ship.”

Castle in the air

Lieven Standaert: "Zeppelins are the ultimate castles in the air, every
few years a concept for another type of airship comes along. Some 5
years ago it was the Cargolifter, a gigantic project in Germany to
design a zeppelin with a length of 250 metres. The idea was to pick up
anything that was too large for conventional road transport and put it
down 500 kilometres further."



"In Germany zeppelins are still the stuff of legends, so they received
serious funding. They built a huge hangar and they put 80 engineers in
there to find out how to realise this thing. But while the engineers
were calculating, they passed their deadline by 2 years, they had
enormous overheads, and they went broke. The hangar was built, and it is
the largest one in Europe. The ship, however, was never realized.”

"From the start, my ship was designed to be built with low-tech and
low-cost building materials. Conventional airships have the form of a
cigar, which is realised by overpressure inside the ship. This enables a
light construction and a fast aerodynamic shape, aimed at speed.
However, this kind of construction is very vulnerable, because the skin
is an essential part of the construction."



"If there is a leak, the ship loses overpressure suddenly, it loses its
shape and it loses all control. And with a round belly like this, a
zeppelin is completely unmanageable on the ground: several airships were
damaged irreparably because a blast of wind smashed them against the
hangar."

Low-tech

“My design does not need overpressure to preserve a stable form, which
means that the forces on the skin become much smaller. The Aeromodeller
has a wide frame which absorbs these bending forces. This makes the
zeppelin heavier and slower than other airships, but it also makes it
sturdier, and much easier and cheaper to build. You don’t need a woven
skin material. A light thermoplastic foil will suffice.

"If you want to accomplish such a high-flying project, you have to think
very practical. An important part of the exhibition deals with the
question of how to build this thing with 3 people, cheap materials and a
flat-iron."



"The full explanation is a bit more complex, of course, but this is the
essence. Focus on the design to build a functioning prototype with
modest means. Invest your money in the prototype, not in a hangar. Keep
your overheads low, so that you can carry out experiments. Make sure you
don’t need scaffolding or high cranes, but design it so that you can
build it on ground level. And then, technologically speaking, this is
just a gigantic, ultralight tent. Then you have something that you can
rig up for the price of a large house."

Scale models, drawings, plans and test results of the Aeromodeller II
are on display in Antwerp, Belgium, until the end of February ([find
more information here](http://www.transitzone.be/)). The website of
Lieven Standaert has [more illustrations of the concept and the building
techniques](http://www.aeromodeller2.be/). The texts are in Dutch, but
will be translated into English .
