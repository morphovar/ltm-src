[As we wrote two years
ago]({filename}/posts/body-insulation-thermal-underwear.md),
insulation of the body is more energy efficient than insulation of
living space. Because of its excellent insulating properties, modern
thermal underclothing makes it possible to burn the heating at much
lower temperatures without sacrificing comfort or sex appeal. The
potential energy savings are huge, and the costs are almost nil.

This low-tech insulation strategy can also be applied to heating the
body. In use since World War Two, electrically heated clothes have
become more effective and comfortable in recent years. While their use
outdoors increases energy consumption, heated clothes have the potential
to save massive amounts of energy indoors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electrically heated clothing is used by soldiers, adventurers, hunters,
winter sports enthusiasts, bikers and construction workers \[1\]. Heated
leather jackets were already used by pilots in World War Two. Bikers
have used the technology for decades, using the battery of their
motorbikes to supply the required energy.



The arrival of compact lithium-ion batteries has increased the
performance and diversity of electrically heated clothing. There are now
more types of heated clothes on the market: jackets, vests, pants,
socks, underclothing, baselayers, sweaters, scarfs, shoes and gloves.
Some have even become fashionable.

The energy for these garments is supplied by one or two relatively small
and light batteries, hidden in a special pocket, which supply the lucky
owner with some five hours of warmth. Some brands offer the possibility
to plug in heated gloves or socks in a heated pants or jacket, so that
they don't need a separate battery.

Carbon Fibres

Also new is the use of carbon fibres as a heating element. This material
is flexible and can be inserted anywhere in the clothes without creating
discomfort for the wearer. Carbon fibres are replacing embedded heating
wires, which are rigid and heavy, break easily, and require more energy.
Making use of low voltages for safety, electrically heated clothing
comes with a button on the outside which enables the regulation of the
heating system.

Unfortunately, electrically heated clothing doesn't save energy when it
is used outdoors. Like most technologies that increase comfort, it
increases energy consumption. The big advantage for people who work or
play outdoors is that heated clothing keeps them warm during breaks in
activity, when body temperature can decrease quickly.

Effective and Efficient

When used as a heating strategy indoors, however, electrically heated
clothing is as sustainable as it can get. A fully heated wardrobe --
pants, socks, underclothing, shirt and vest&mdash;has an energy output of
100 watts maximum. There's no need for the heating elements to get very
hot because they remain close to the skin. An electric heater of that
calibre used for space heating brings little comfort, even if it heats a
very small room.



Using electrically heated clothing we could be more comfortable at even
lower indoor temperatures than when using thermal clothing (which
already offered heating till near-freezing conditions). Another
advantage of electric clothes is that you need less volume and weight to
stay comfortable. This effectiveness and efficiency of heated clothes
has been confirmed by scientific research \[2\].

Electrically heated clothing can also be used without activating the
heating elements&mdash;the good insulation of the garments traps body heat,
as with thermal clothes. In this sense, heated clothing is similar to a
bicycle with an electrically assisted motor. Unlike electric cars or
smartphones, the clothes don't become useless when the battery dies.

Wired or Wireless?

The only unsustainable feature of electrically heated clothing is its
use of batteries. A wireless energy supply is very practical, but it
would be perfectly possible to connect electrically heated clothes
directly to the grid, just as you would do with your phone and laptop.
It would function like an electric blanket or sleeping bag. Since many
of us are sedentry, this is not as far-fetched as it may seem.
