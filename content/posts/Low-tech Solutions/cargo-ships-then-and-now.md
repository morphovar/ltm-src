On an early afternoon last month, the *Eugen Maersk* (the world's
longest ocean freighter at 1,300 feet) has left  
Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on the tail end of a journey from Shanghai.  
But the giant freighter is [cruising at 10
knots](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123913890018398337.html#mod=testMod),
well shy of her  
26-knot top speed. At about half speed, fuel consumption drops to
100-150 tons of fuel  
a day from 350 tons, saving as much as \$5,000 an hour.

The German *Preussen* (picture above), the largest sailing ship ever
built, was launched in  
1902 and travelled mainly between Hamburg  
(Germany) and Iquique (Chile). It was rammed by a large steam vessel  
in  
1910. A one way trip between Germany and Chile took the cargo vessel
[between 58 and 79  
days](http://werften.fischtown.de/archiv/preussen1.htm). The best
average speed over a one way trip was [13.7
knots](http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Fivemast_ships/Preussen%281902%29.html).
The lowest average speed was 10 knots.

One giant container ship can emit almost the same amount of cancer and
asthma-causing chemicals as [50 million
cars](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/09/shipping-pollution),
study finds. Time for [a new age of
sail]({filename}/posts/sailing-ships-large-crew-automated-control.md).
