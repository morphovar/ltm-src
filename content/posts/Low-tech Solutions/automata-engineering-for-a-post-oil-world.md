Our fascination with sophisticated technology lies at the core of many
of our present-day problems. Yet, it need not be. By definition,
technical virtuosity doesn't need to result in yet another electronic
gadget or an even faster accelerating sports car. It can also lead to
stunning yet completely harmless artefacts called "automata".

These are mostly hand-cranked machines that can be extremely complex,
often with the only purpose of astonishing the spectator. Automata have
been built for more than 2,000 years, but contemporary artists have
elevated the craft to a higher level. Aside from their emotional value,
automata offer a glimpse of a future, post-oil technology.



There is a lot to say about [the history of
automata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton), but it is the modern
work that deserves attention. Contrary to the examples that can be found
in museums and old documents, present-day automata do not try to hide
their internal mechanisms. The purpose of an automaton is no longer to
make a mechanical copy of reality. Today, builders of automata want to
evoke emotions, they want to make us dream.

The often fragile combination of gears, wheels and wires, as well as the
sounds they make, are now an important part of the whole. Yet, automata
are no [Rube Goldberg
machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine), in which
the mechanisms have been made needlessly complex. The mechanism of an
automaton can be extremely elaborate, but never needlessly so. The
makers of automata are not mocking technology, they are celebrating it.

Hand-cranked

However, they celebrate another kind of technology than the one we have
grown accustomed to. Automata make use of very simple materials, often
wood and/or iron. Some contain scavenged materials. Most automata are
hand-cranked, some are driven by wind, water or a small electric motor.
None of them incorporate electronics. Embodied and operational energy
use are almost zero.

Medieval millwrights

Automata show that stunning complexity and sophisticated technology can
go hand in hand with the simplest of materials and the lowest possible
energy use. In other words, they prove that engineers can still really
let themselves go in a post-oil world.



On a purely technical level, the building of automata requires an
ingenuity which is closely related to that of a medieval millwright.
These builders of
[watermills](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/water-powered-machines/),
[windmills]({filename}/posts/history-of-industrial-windmills.md)
and [lifting
devices]({filename}/posts/history-of-human-powered-cranes.md)
also succeeded in constructing machines which performed many diverse,
complex and precise operations with the use of very basic materials and
limited energy sources.

This analogy is interesting, because contrary to watermills, windmills
and human powered cranes, automata have been developed further
throughout the twentieth century. This means that they can teach us some
unique things when it comes to designing future technologies.

Enough said. Automata should be watched when they come alive. Pictures
and words don't do them right. For the layman, it's hard to conceive how
one simple twist of a hand crank can launch so many different movements
at often unpredictable time intervals. Check out the videos and links
