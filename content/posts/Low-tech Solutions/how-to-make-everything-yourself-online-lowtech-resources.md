[Energy Bulletin](http://www.energybulletin.net/) [pointed
us](http://www.energybulletin.net/node/50309) to the website of
[Practical Action](http://practicalaction.org/home) (previously known as
the Schumacher Centre for Technology & Development), an online resource
devoted to low-technology solutions for developing countries. The site
hosts [many
manuals](http://practicalaction.org/practicalanswers/categories.php)
that can also be of interest for low-tech DIYers in the developed world.
They cover energy, agriculture, food processing, construction and
manufacturing, just to name some important categories.


would like to add to this the impressive online library put together by
software engineer Alex Weir. The [900 documents listed
here](http://www.cd3wd.com/cd3wd_40/cd3wd/index.htm) (13 gigabytes in
total) are not as well organised and presented as those of Practical
Action, but there is a wealth of information that is not found anywhere
else. The library is also hosted
[here](http://www.fastonline.org/CD3WD_40/CD3WD/INDEX.HTM) (without
search engine).


Other interesting online resources that offer manuals and instructions
are [Appropedia](http://www.appropedia.org/Welcome_to_Appropedia) and
[Howtopedia](http://www.howtopedia.org/en/Main_Page). These are all
wiki's, so you can cooperate. The [Centre for Alternative
technologies](http://www.cat.org.uk/index.tmpl?refer=index&init=1) has
many interesting manuals, too, but the majority of those are not for
free.
