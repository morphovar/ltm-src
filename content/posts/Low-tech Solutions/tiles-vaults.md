The craftsmanship associated with timbrel vaulting has long vanished,
but the achievements are still with us today.

Brick, stone and concrete are materials strong in compression (you can
pile them up almost indefinitely), but weak in tension (if the
structural breadth increases, the material has to be supported by many
columns or it collapses).

Nowadays, this problem is solved by steel structures or the use of steel
reinforced concrete - the tensile strength of steel is significantly
more than that of bricks, stone or plain concrete. Pre World War II, the
weak tensile strength of brick was compensated for by superior
craftsmanship.

The "timbrel vault" allowed for structures that today no architect would
dare to build without steel reinforcements. The technique was cheap,
fast, ecological and durable.

The [method of timbrel
vaulting](http://architecture.mit.edu/class/guastavino/resources/writings/ramage_text.pdf)
was developed in the 14th century around the Mediterranean, although its
precise origins are unknown. The timbrel vault is also known as a
"masonry vault", "Catalan vault", "tiled vault", "laminated vault",
"flat vault" and "layered vault" (derived from Spanish, French, Italian
and Catalonian descriptions).

A roof of tiles

Timbrel vaulting differs substantially from the Roman method of arch
building, which relies on gravity. A Roman vault consists of a single
layer of thick, wedge-shaped stones (see below).



The timbrel vault does not rely on gravity but on the adhesion of
several layers of overlapping tiles which are woven together with
fast-setting mortar. If just one layer of thin tiles was used, the
structure would collapse, but adding two or three layers makes the
resulting laminated shell almost as strong as reinforced concrete.

The result defies common sense, because a timbrel vault is very thin
compared to a Roman vault, while at the same time it is capable of
bearing much higher loads. This of course enables wider spans and
gentler curves.



The timbrel vault was perfected in Catalonia, the north-eastern region
of Spain. There already were some notable medieval examples, like the
[Santa Maria del
Mar](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paco_calvino/530552355/in/set-72157607202289124/)
(below) and the Santa Maria del Pi, both churches in Barcelona, and the
[Cathedral of Gerona](http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catedral_de_Girona)
(the widest gothic nave in Europe - second and third picture below).







At the end of 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the timbrel
vault was rediscovered by the Catalonian architects of the [Modernisme
movement](http://www.rutadelmodernisme.com/default.aspx?idioma=en&contenido=body_amoriodien.htm).
Some striking examples are the [crypt of the Colonia
Guell](http://www.gaudidesigner.com/es/colonia-guell.html) (second
below), which Antoni Gaudí designed in a very low-tech fashion by
[hanging
ropes](http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_VIDA/fotobras/colonia/1102.jpg)
and [weights from the
ceiling](http://www.flickr.com/photos/vikingospub/2952029629/) (the
building has now suffered [a disastrous
restoration](http://www.gaudi.pedro-uhart.com/uk/colonia-guell-la-cripta-guell---restauracion-desastrosa-de-una-obra-maestra-de-gaudi_416.html)),
the [Aymerich Amat i

in Terrassa, a textile factory built by Lluís Moncunill i Parellada
(first below), or the [Celler Cooperatiu de Pinell de
Brai](http://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catedral_del_vi) by Cèsar Martinell
(third below).







Most masterpieces of catalan vaulting, however, are in the United
States. The method was previously unknown in the Americas, until a
family by the name of Guastavinos imported it. [Rafael
Guastavino](http://www.massintransit.com/nc/stlawrence1-nc/images/nc3b.jpg),
born in Valencia in 1842, improved the centuries-old technique and
renamed it "cohesive construction". He substituted bricks with thin
tiles and the traditional mortar with rapidly hardening Portland cement,
which enabled him to build vaults 3 to 5 times wider than the typical
size of traditional timbrel arching.

Early in his career, around 1880, Guastavino immigrated to the US.
There, he and his successors collaborated for more than half a century
with architects on the construction of more than 1,000 buildings and
structures, many of them renowned monuments today. Nearly 400 of them
are located in New York. The Guastavinos made masonry floors, ceilings,
vaults, domes and stairs. Their accomplishments were fairly unknown to
the general public as they were working as contractors and not as
architects.







Some examples of the Guastavinos' work are the Boston Public Library ([a
well documented
project](http://architecture.mit.edu/class/guastavino/features/lisa/mroszczyk%20thesis.pdf)),
the ceiling of the [Oyster Bar in Grand Central
Terminal](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/record/archives/vol21/vol21_iss25/record2125.17.html)
(second picture above), the [reception hall of Ellis
Island](http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1024/1368294142_95c11eb90a.jpg?v=0)
(third above), Carnegie Hall, the US Supreme Court Building, the
Nebraska State Capitol, the Queensboro bridge, the US Army War College
in Washington and the [Cathedral of St. John the
Divine](http://en.structurae.de/photos/index.cfm?JS=120487) (which has
the largest Guastavino dome ever built - see picture above).

Rafael Guastavino and his son (also named Rafael) were granted more than
20 patents and by 1891 the company had offices in New York, Boston,
Providence, Milwaukee and Chicago. In 1900 they opened their own factory
to manufacture the tiles.


Economical and fast

The popularity of the timbrel vault was not restricted to its aesthetic
appeal. It was simply a very fast and economical method, for two
reasons. Firstly, and logically, much less building material was
required. Secondly, there was no need for wooden scaffolding. Building a
Roman vault demands large amounts of wood, as every arch is required to
be supported by a wooden centering for a long period after initial
construction.


The masonry vault, on the other hand, is self-supporting apart from some
temporarily required, light shiftable formwork at the beginning of the
job. While constructing a timbrel vault, workers simply stood on the
work of the day before (which was two to four inches thick).

These huge savings in both building materials and construction equipment
meant that the Guastavinos could offer much lower prices than their
competitors.

Durable and fire-proof

Cohesive construction also made buildings fire-proof (an example of this
is the Santa Maria del Mar in Barcelona, which burned for 11 days during
the Spanish Civil War, without collapsing or too much damage). There
have been some major city fires during the 19th century (like the great
Chicago fire in 1871), and the Guastavinos aptly saw the marketing
potential: they soon renamed themselves the "Guastavino Fireproof
Construction Company". There were more advantages to the construction.
The floors, ceilings, arches and stairs were sound-insulating and
resistant to floods, dampness and the lodgement of pests such as rats
and roaches.



Convincing the public


construction also proved to be very durable. During the restoration of
Ellis Island in the 1980s, only 17 of almost 29,000 tiles had to be
replaced. And of course, several churches are living proof of the
achievements of timbrel vaulting in the Middle Ages.

The Guastavinos initially had a hard time convincing the public that
their ultra-thin and ultra-light arches were strong and safe. To
persuade their buyers, the technique was demonstrated in public (see
picture right).

In many ways, timbrel vaulting offered similar properties to reinforced
concrete, but without the use of steel.

It was achieved without computers or engineering calculations, relying
instead on intuition and practice.


art schools

According to Rafael Guastavino, the masonry vault would become the main
construction material of the future. He proved to be wrong. The
Guastavinos firm closed in 1962, twelve years after his son died. Rising
labour costs and the arrival of steel and concrete building methods
rendered the technique virtually obsolete. Still, two later examples
deserve attention.

One was the Uruguayan architect [Eladio
Dieste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eladio_Dieste), who applied the
timbrel vault to modern buildings (also including steel reinforcements,
which made it possible to build to wider breadths, [this
church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Iglesia_Atlantida_Dieste_1.jpg)
in Atlándida being an example).

Most notable, and most relevant, are [Cuba's art
schools](http://humanthesis.blogspot.com/2008/02/cubas-national-art-schools.html)
(all three pictures below), an unfinished project that was commenced
from 1961 to 1965. The ambitious plan forsaw a national complex of art
schools. As building materials were scarce, and labour was plentiful,
timbrel vaulting was applied. The knowledge was delivered by a former
mason of Antoni Gaudí.

Relevance today

Scarcity of materials is still an issue in Cuba, and it is increasingly
becoming an issue for the whole world. Masonry vaults may just come in
handy again, one day.

Recently there has been [more research on the structural
behavior](http://www.atamturktur.com/publications/structural-assessment-of-guastavino-domes/table-of-contents)
of this construction system and some people, for instance at the MIT,
also try to revive the technique by practice, which has resulted in
[several do-it-yourself timbrel
vaults](http://architecture.mit.edu/class/guastavino/features/pines/pines.htm)
(see below). MIT and the Boston Public Library plan to organise an
exhibition on the Guastavinos in 2009.
