written a book that reads as a practical  
interpretation of Low-tech Magazine: “[Toolbox for sustainable city  
living, a do-it-ourselves
guide](http://www.southendpress.org/2006/items/87804)”.  
  
Both authors regard the current  
ecotech trend as a salve for guilty consciences and focus instead on  
low-tech systems and solutions that can be built and maintained by  
people without any scientific or engineering background, using cheap,  
salvaged and recycled materials.

How to depave a  
roadway and reclaim the land for food production? How to clean  
contaminated soils and water bodies? How to recycle wastewater in a  
scavenged bathtub? How to raise turkey, ducks, insects and fish? How  
to cultivate mushrooms on logs? How to build a windmill or a rocket  
stove? The book provides a toolbox of  
skills, technologies, tactics and step-by-step instructions to give  
city dwellers access to, and control over, life’s necessities.

Publisher South End  
Press has granted Low-tech Magazine permission to publish an excerpt of
the book online. It gives detailed instructions on [how to build a  
floating trash island, a low-tech way to clean up rivers, canals, lakes
and
estuaries](http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/how-to-build-a-floating-trash-island.html).
