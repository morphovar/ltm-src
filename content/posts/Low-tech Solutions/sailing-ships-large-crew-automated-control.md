Lloyd Alter at Treehugger talks about [our article on cargo
ships]({filename}/posts/cargo-ships-then-and-now.md)
and wonders [if it is time for a new age of
sail](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/04/slow-freight-wind-powered-transport.php).
One reader comments that sailing boats require a much larger crew than
today's cargo vessels, which would make a comeback of wind power
[unrealistic](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/04/slow-freight-wind-powered-transport.php#comment-254700).
Maybe, but these days, sailing boats can also be controlled by computers
instead of sailors.

If you want a revival of sail the ecotech way, you can have it.

The need for a large crew  
to operate the rigs makes sailing ships not only expensive to  
operate, it also means that a significant part of the cargo space is  
taken up by cabins, provisions and water supplies. Sailings boats did
better  
than rowing boats (which had a very limited range because of their  
even larger crew) but they were no competition for later steamboats  
and today's diesel ships, which can get along with only a handful of
sailors.



Automated sail handling  

The 1902 Preussen ([pictured here
yesterday]({filename}/posts/cargo-ships-then-and-now.md))
was the first ship to automate sail handling. It had no  
auxiliary engines for propulsion, but it made use of steam power  
for the operation of the winches, hoists and pumps. This limited the
crew to 48 men. By comparison: the
[Kruzenshtern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruzenshtern_%28ship%29)
(picture above) a very large sailing vessel without mechanised control,
has a crew of 257 men.

The Preussen had 5 masts (with a maximum height of 68 meters) and  
47 sails (with a total surface area of 5,560 square meters or 60,000  
square feet). It had a length of 147 meters (438 ft.) and a  
load-carrying capacity of 8,000 tons.

Today, sailing boats can be operated with even smaller crews. The [Royal
Clipper](http://www.starclippers.com/ships_rc.html),  
a steel-hulled five masted cruise ship built in 2000 and inspired by  
the Pruessen (it is only slightly smaller), can be handled with a crew  
as small as 20, using powered controls. The Royal Clipper (picture  
below) is the largest sailing ship in service today (although it does  
have auxiliary engines).



In 2006, automated control was taken to the extreme with the [Maltese
Falcon](http://www.symaltesefalcon.com/index2.asp),  
the yacht of Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tom Perkins. The 88  
meter (290 foot) long luxury yacht can be operated by one man using a  
central control unit. A small crew is required for maintenance and  
fixing problems, but nobody needs to be in the rig during  
sailing.

Touch of a button  

Handling, hoisting and lowering of the sails is done at the touch of  
a button - the sails roll into the mast. The Maltese Falcon (pictured  
below) has 3 masts (58 meters high) and a total sail area of 2,400  
square meters (almost 26,000 square feet). It is about half the size of  
the Preussen.  



The Maltese Falcon is equipped with the
[DynaRig](http://www.runningtideyachts.com/dynarig/)  
technology, a concept that was developed in Germany by W. Prolls in the  
1960s as a propulsion  
alternative for commercial ships in the face of a looming energy  
crisis. It was never applied then - the Maltese Falcon is the first  
proof-of-concept. Now some smaller versions have been designed,  
too.

High-tech materials

The  
DynaRig is a high-tech version of a "square-rigger", the kind of sail  
used by the Preussen. The main difference is that the  
yards (the horizontal spars) do not swing around a fixed mast but are  
attached permanently to a rotating mast. Only recent developments in  
high-tech materials such as carbon fibre have permitted this  
technology. The yards keep the sail in a fixed, wing-like form.



Contrary  
to a traditional sailboat, the rig of the Maltese Falcon scarcely shows  
any [ropes or
wires]({filename}/posts/lost-knowledge-ropes-and-knots.md).
But it does have dozens of computers and microprocessors,  
connected by 131,000 feet of cable. The Preussen is low-tech, the
Maltese Falcon is ecotech.

Making money

The Maltese Falcon is a  
sumptuous yacht that is hard to  
qualify as environmentally friendly. Still, it demonstrates the  
effectiveness of powering very large boats with a modern sail, capable  
of being handled by the small crew necessary for a commercial cargo ship
to have a chance of being profitable.

I prefer the low-tech way; higher taxes on fuel, lower taxes on labour.
But if you want a revival of sail the ecotech way, you can have it.
