The freshly launched "International Traditional Knowledge Institute"
(ITKI) is an ambitious effort to preserve, restore and promote the
re-use of traditional skills and inventions from all over the world. It
includes an online encyclopaedia of low-tech know-how, though it will
take many years before it is completed.

Lewis Mumford [wrote in
1970](http://www.notechmagazine.com/2010/04/polytechnics-versus-monotechnics.html):

> "The great feat of medieval technics was that it was able to promote
> and absorb many important changes without losing the immense carryover
> of inventions and skills from earlier cultures. In this lies one of
> its vital points of superiority over the modern mode of monotechnics,
> which boasts of effacing, as fast and as far as possible, the
> technical achievements of earlier periods."

The Traditional Knowledge Institute [writes in
2010](http://issuu.com/ipogea/docs/tkwb?mode=embed&layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&showFlipBtn=true):

> "Today, traditional knowledge is in danger and its disappearance would
> not only cause the loss of people's capability to keep and pass on the
> artistic and natural heritage, but also of an extraordinary source of
> knowledge and cultural diversity from which appropriate innovative
> solutions can be derived today and in the future."



The idea to set up a [data bank of traditional
knowledge](http://www.tkwb.org/web/?page_id=4) was launched by Italian
[Pietro Laureano](http://www.laureano.it/web/?page_id=13&language=en),
architect, town planner, author and UNESCO consultant on arid areas,
Islamic society and endangered ecosystems. Laureano worked in the Sahara
desert for eight years and coordinated pilot projects in Algeria,
Jordan, Yemen and Ethiopia. "We want to pick up the thread of tradition
again", he said in an
[interview](http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2010/07/10/une-banque-mondiale-pour-les-savoirs-traditionnels_1386237_3244.html)
with French newspaper *Le Monde* earlier this week. "Cultural heritage
is not only to be found in monuments and galleries. It is also in the
works and the landscapes of man."

the moment, the project exists entirely on paper, except for a physical
site currently in ruins (the Gualchiere di Remole, a medieval walled
town in Italy which will house the headquarters of the organisation),
and a [prototype](http://www.mappeonline.com/unesco/atlas/index.htm) of
the "Traditional Knowledge World Bank" - which looks very promising.

Take a look at the [icon
page](http://www.mappeonline.com/unesco/atlas/data/icons/home.htm), for
example. It reads like a "to-write list" for Low-tech Magazine, and in
fact some of the topics are in the making.

./>}](http://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e888330133f249b74e970b-pi)However,
it is a "to-write list" for the UNESCO as well, because the data bank is
mainly an empty box. Behind most of the icons there is only fragmentary
information or no information at all. Most data now available deals with
water management in arid areas.

Dozens of experts will need many years to archive, study and publish
traditional skills from all over the world, said Laureano in the
interview. The headquarters, which will be a showcase for traditional
technologies, would be finished earlier, in 3 to 4 years.

Mission statement

From the [summary of the
project](http://issuu.com/ipogea/docs/tkwb?mode=embed&layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&showFlipBtn=true)

> "The Traditional Knowledge Institute gathers and protects historical
> knowledge and promotes and certifies innovative practises based on the
> modern re-proposal of tradition as well. Using traditional knowledge
> does not mean to reapply directly the techniques of the past, but
> rather to understand the logic of this model of knowlegde. It is a
> dynamic system able to incorporate innovation subjected to the test of
> the long term and thus achieves local and environmental
> sustainability."

The Institute is also an economic actor: "Companies that reintroduce
traditional techniques in innovative ways or who look for appropriate
solutions will be selected". The initiative is aimed at poor and
developing countries, and that's for now my only criticism: I think the
first world needs exactly the same kind of thinking and technology.


The work is supported by UNESCO, the UNCCD, the Italian Ministry of
Environment, and the Regional Government of Tuscany. There is more
information to be found at the [Research Centre on Local and Traditional
knowledge](http://www.ipogea.org/web/?page_id=23&language=en)(IPOGEA,
created in 1993) and at [The International Centre on Traditional
Knowledge](http://www.itknet.org/web/?page_id=14&language=en) (IKTNET,
created in 2007). Both organisations will be responsible for the
development of the database. On IKTNET is another database
[prototype](http://www.itknet.org/databank/) to be found, which looks
and feels like a blog.
