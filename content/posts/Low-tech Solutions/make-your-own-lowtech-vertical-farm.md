The ingenious low-cost vertical farms of Willem Van Cotthem are within
reach of everybody.



[Vertical farming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming) has
become a popular idea, but what is mostly forgotten is that the energy
required for the operation and construction of vertical farms largely
negates the ecological advantages. This also applies to small-scale
systems, like those of
[Philips](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/11/vertical-farm-philips.php)
(a concept) or [Inka Biospheric Solutions](http://inka.fm/index.php) (a
product).


while ago two New York ladies made headlines with their "[Window
farms](http://windowfarms.org/)", described as a kind of low-tech indoor
vertical farming system (illustration on the right). Upon a closer look,
however, I found the method to be rather high-tech and cumbersome, in
spite of the use of plastic bottles. A window farm is based on
hydroponics, it makes use of lamps, pumps and electricity, it still
requires you to buy quite a lot of new stuff, and the whole thing would
surely come crashing down if I were to install it.

The Belgian professor Willem Van Cotthem seems to have designed a
do-it-yourself vertical kitchen garden system that truly deserves the
low-tech label. On his blog, "Container gardening", he explains how to
transform normal plastic bottles into [efficient containers (and a
container rack) for growing all kinds of
plants](http://containergardening.wordpress.com/2007/08/14/gardening-ideas/),
even [young
trees](http://containergardening.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/bottle-reforestation-part-1-willem-van-cotthem/)
(to be transplanted when reaching sufficient height). The beauty is that
the water supply can be
[automated](http://containergardening.wordpress.com/2007/07/23/different-ways-to-use-plastic-bottles-for-gardening-willem/)
without the use of electricity, and that his way of installing a
vertical garden looks much simpler and sturdier.

Willem Van Cotthem is a researcher specializing in combating
desertification, an occupation he describes on his other blog,
"[Desertification](http://desertification.wordpress.com/)". Here lies
the origin of his low-cost, low-tech methods to grow plants and crops.
Van Cotthem manages to grow vegetables and fruits in the middle of the
desert with minimal water
([pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24356485@N00/)). Apart from the
methods using plastic bottles described above, he also uses
[mini-greenhouses](http://desertification.wordpress.com/2010/03/06/mini-greenhouses-first-step-to-combat-desertification-willem-van-cotthem/)
made of trash (yoghurt pots, plastic bags) to produce vegetable and
[(fruit) tree
seedlings](http://containergardening.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/mini-greenhouses-for-container-gardening-part-2-plastic-bottles-willem-van-cotthem/).
All systems can be used both indoors and outdoors.



What all these methods have in common, is that they hardly use any
water, basically by minimizing evaporation. Moreover, because of the low
cost (using 100 percent trash), the systems can be used even by the
poorest of people. Plastic rubbish is, unfortunately,
[everywhere](http://www.notechmagazine.com/2009/10/plastics-in-the-world-of-tomorrow-plastics-in-the-world-of-today.html).
Van Cotthem's blogs can be a bit chaotic to navigate, but his work is
definitely worth a look.
