Unlike solar and wind energy, human power is always available, no matter
the season or time of day. Unlike fossil fuels, human power can be a
clean energy source, and its potential increases as the human population
grows. In the [*Human Power Plant*](http://www.humanpowerplant.be/),
Low-tech Magazine and artist Melle Smets investigate the feasibility of
human energy production in the 21st century.

To find out if human power can sustain a modern lifestyle, we are
designing plans to convert a 22 floors vacant tower building on the
campus of Utrecht University in the Netherlands into an entirely human
powered student community for 750 people. We're also constructing a
working prototype of the human power plant that supplies the community
with energy.

The *Human Power Plant* is both a technical and a social challenge. A
technical challenge, because there's a lack of scientific and
technological research into human power production. A social challenge,
because unlike a wind turbine, a solar panel or an oil barrel, a human
needs to be motivated in order to produce energy.

## The Rise and Fall of Human Power

Throughout most of history, humans have been the most important source
of mechanical energy. Building cities, digging canals, producing food,
washing clothes, communication and transportation: it all happened with
human muscle power as the main source of energy. Human power was
complemented with animal power, and windmills and watermills became
increasingly important [from the middle ages
onwards]({filename}/posts/history-of-industrial-windmills.md).
Most work, however, we carried out ourselves.

These days, human power plays virtually no role anymore. We have
automated and motorised even the smallest physical efforts. Mechanical
energy is now largely provided by fossil fuels, either as a primary fuel
or converted to electricity. This 'progress' comes at a price.
Industrial society is totally dependent on a steady supply of fossil
fuels and electricity, which makes it very vulnerable to an interruption
in this supply.

Furthermore, fossil fuels are not infinitely available and their
large-scale use causes a host of other problems. On the other hand,
renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power are not always
available, and their manufacturing is [also dependent on fossil
fuels]({filename}/posts/how-sustainable-is-pv-solar-power.md).
Meanwhile, in order to keep in shape and stay healthy, people go to the
gym to exercise, generating energy that's wasted. The *Human Power
Plant* wants to restore the connection between energy demand and energy
supply.

## Why Human Power?

Compared with fossil fuels and renewable energy sources, human power has
a lot of advantages. A human can generate at least as much power as a 1
m2 solar PV panel on a sunny day&mdash;and as much as 10 m2 of solar PV
panels on a heavy overcast day. Human power is a dispatchable energy
source, just like fossil fuels. Its power output is not dependent on the
season, the weather or the time of the day. In fact, humans can be
considered renewable energy sources and batteries at the same time.


Unlike fossil fuels, human power can be a clean energy source, which
produces little or no air pollution and soil contamination. Moreover,
the potential of human power increases as the human population grows,
while all other energy sources need to be shared among an ever-growing
amount of people. Furthermore, unlike solar panels, wind turbines, and
batteries, humans don't need to be manufactured in a factory. In
combination with the right diet, human power is carbon neutral.

Finally, humans are all-round power sources, just like fossil fuels.
They not only supply muscle power that can be converted to mechanical
energy or electricity, but also thermal energy, especially during
exercise: a physically active human being can generate up to 500 watts
of body heat. Furthermore, human waste can be converted to biogas and
fertiliser. Arguably, human power is the most versatile and most
sustainable power source on Earth.

Modern technology has greatly improved the potential of human power
production. On the one hand, many electric devices have become very
energy efficient. For example, solid state lighting consumes roughly ten
times less power than old-fashioned lightbulbs, so that a quick workout
can supply many hours of light. On the other hand, we now have much
better technology for human power production, ranging from sophisticated
exercise machines to biogas power plants.

## Lessons from the Gym

The power output of a human being is determined by three factors: the
person, the duration of the effort, and the mechanical device that is
used to convert human power into useful energy&mdash;human power generation
is often a symbiosis between man and tool or machine. Our legs are
roughly four times stronger than our arms, which means that a human on a
stationary bicycle machine can produce more power (75 to 100 watts) than
a human operating a small hand crank (10 to 30 watts).

During shorter efforts, the mechanical power output of a human being can
increase substantially: up to 500 watts on a bicycle and up to 150 watts
while operating a hand crank over a period of one minute. However, age,
gender and fitness also play an important role. Athletes can generate
more power for a longer period of time&mdash;up to 2,000 watts during three
seconds, or up to 400 watts during one hour. So far the theory, which is
far from complete.

> Exercise machines for strength training are an interesting addition to
> stationary cycling machines for human power production.

During the research phase for the *Human Power Plant*, we followed a
fitness programme to become better human power sources. This was a very
instructive experience. One of the first things we learned is that there
are important differences between individuals, even if they have similar
age, gender and fitness.

Melle, the powerhouse in our team, could lift a heavier weight on almost
any exercise machine. Kris, on the other hand, appeared to have better
endurance, and could beat Melle with triceps and shoulder exercises.
Such differences should be taken into account in order to achieve
optimal energy production - there is no ready-made solution.

We also found out that exercise machines for strength training can
produce a [lot of power in a very short
time](http://www.humanpowerplant.be/2017/05/power-potential-various-exercise-machines.html),
making them an interesting addition to stationary cycling machines for
human power production. A five minute workout (including two breaks of
one minute each) can supply more than 15 Wh of electricity, enough to
charge a quarter of a laptop's battery or to power a desk lamp for 3
hours.

Finally, we quickly discovered that gyms are pretty boring places. The
exercise equipment is often positioned in such a way that people all
look in the same direction, which excludes all but the most primitive
communication. And, while a [stationary
bicycle]({filename}/posts/pedal-powered-farms-and-factories.md)
is considered to be the most energy-efficient human power machine, we
found out that stationary cycling is no fun at all.

## How to Motivate Human Power?

The last point deserves extra attention. Unlike a windmill, a solar
panel or an oil barrel, human power needs to be *motivated* in order to
produce energy. If we make a switch to human power production, would
everybody generate their own power for the sake of sustainability? Would
people pay others to do it for them? Or, would people *force* others to
do it for them?



A financial reward won’t do the trick, because at the current energy
prices in the Netherlands, a human generating electricity would earn
only 0.015€ per hour. Consequently, unless environmental awareness
increases dramatically, the use of human power could open the door to
new forms of slavery. Is such slavery justified for a reduction in
CO2-emissions? Could we force refugees or criminals to produce power?

These are disturbing questions, because the history of human power is --
broadly&mdash;also the history of slavery. These days we import oil, coal
and uranium, in the past we imported slaves. Luckily, there may be a
third possibility. We can try and motivate people by making human energy
production more fun, social, and exciting.

The few commercially available devices for human energy production are
entirely focused on energy efficiency&mdash;there's no attention to fun or
motivation. They are also designed for emergency purposes, not for
prolonged and daily use. For example, most hand cranks are made as
compact as possible, while a larger device would be much more
comfortable to use.

## Designing the Prototype

For the design of our prototype human power plant, we wanted to address
these issues. We teamed up with makers and sports coaches to develop
fitness machines that are suited for different types of human power
sources, are fun too use, and produce a maximum amount of power.

To make power production more social, we decided that power producers
should be able to talk to each other. They can even bring their pets to
help with power production, creating a cosy and home-like atmosphere.
This is not a new idea: dogs were commonly used as a source of
mechanical power in pre-industrial times, and also provided their owners
with a source of warmth.

### Water Under Pressure

For extra motivation, all exercise machines in our prototype human power
plant are facing a jacuzzi & shower where girls are invited to encourage
the boys to flex their muscles and generate more power. Of course, the
gender roles could be reversed, but during the first experiments we
discovered that this is less energy-efficient. Girls don't seem to get
motivated by guys in jacuzzis, at least not to the extent that guys get
motivated by girls in jacuzzis.

The jacuzzi is not a gimmick, but an essential part of the prototype
human power plant. That's because we opted for [water under
pressure]({filename}/posts/power-from-the-tap-water-motors.md)
as the energy carrier. The kinetic energy produced by humans and their
pets is pumped into a pressure vessel, which produces water under
pressure that is led to water turbines which supply mechanical energy
and electricity. The jacuzzi is the receiving reservoir of this closed
system.

With the choice for water under pressure, we want to make energy more
visible and audible. More importantly, however, it allows us to produce
electricity without the use of
[batteries]({filename}/posts/sustainability-off-grid-solar-power.md)
and
[electronics]({filename}/posts/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.md)
-- which are not sustainable components. In our human power plant, the
[hydraulic
accumulator]({filename}/posts/hydraulic-accumulator-power-water-networks.md)
takes the place of the battery and the voltage regulator. Small
variations in human power production can be smoothed out, keeping the
voltage constant. Longer term energy storage is provided by the humans
themselves.

## For Rent: 750 Human Powered Student Rooms

To find out if we could sustain a modern lifestyle with human power
alone, we teamed up with architects to design plans for the conversion
of a 22 floors tower building into an entirely human powered student
community of 750 people.

The [Willem C. Van Unnik
building](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_C._van_Unnikgebouw#/media/File:Willem_C._van_Unnikgebouw.JPG)
is the tallest building on the campus of Utrecht University. The
concrete, steel and glass monolith, which occupies a central position on
the campus, was built in the late 1960s and has been mostly empty for
years. Maintaining it is an important cost for the university, who owns
the building.

> A time schedule tells the students when they have to produce
> elelectricity and heat, and when to perform other services for the
> community.

Because the university has the ambition to become carbon neutral in
2030, we propose to turn a problem into an opportunity. The ecological
footprint of the human powered Van Unnik student community will be close
to zero, and the building is already there.

Each student in the human powered Van Unnik student building is
responsible for generating the electricity that’s used in his or her
individual room. The lower floors of the building are reserved for
communal energy production, providing both electricity and warmth. This
energy is used to heat the building, prepare food, wash clothes, take
showers, and so on.

More energy is supplied by a biogas plant, which is operated by the
students and runs on their food waste and excrements. A time schedule
tells every student when he or she has to produce electricity and heat,
and when to perform other services for the community.

## Power Generation Schedule

According to our preliminary calculations, an entirely human powered
student building is achievable. The students would maintain a modern
lifestyle, including hot showers, computers, and washing machines. On
the other hand, they would have to produce energy for 2 to 6 hours per
day, depending on the season and their individual and communal
preferences.

A human powered student community has enormous potential for a reduction
in energy use. If students have to generate their own power, they are
much less likely to waste it. How far would students go to reduce their
efforts? Would hot showers go out of fashion? Would salads be the next
culinary trend? Would typewriters make a comeback?

Energy use is also lowered by encouraging the communal organisation of
daily household tasks, just like in the old days. Finally, the human
powered student community applies low-tech solutions, such as fireless
cookers, thermal underclothing, and heat exchange showers, which all
maximize comfort in the context of a limited energy supply.

The design of the building and the construction of the prototype human
power plant is [documented on a separate blog: Human Power
Plant](http://www.humanpowerplant.be/). It's a work-in-progress, and
comments are welcome. Once the project is complete, we will post an
update on Low-tech Magazine.
