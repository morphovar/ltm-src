If we cut the average speed of all vehicles by half, fuel consumption
would decrease by a whopping 75 percent.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Breaking speed records was an almost daily occurence throughout the 20th
century. Cars, ships, planes and trains became faster and faster, year
after year. Because the power needed to push an object through air
increases with the cube of velocity, this race to ever higher speeds
raises energy consumption exponentially.

Engineers treat velocity as a non-variable, while in fact it is the most
powerful factor to save a really huge amount of energy - with just one
stroke, at minimal cost, and without the need for new technology. Lower
speeds combined with more energy efficient engines, better aerodynamics
and lighter materials could make fuel savings even larger. Picture :

"The fastest car in the world reaches 10 times the speed of a normal
vehicle cruising the highway, but it consumes 550 times more fuel"

</div>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Air resistance ([drag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29))
increases with the square of speed, and therefore the power needed to
push an object through air increases with the *cube* of the velocity
(see the formula
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29#Drag_at_high_velocity)).
If a car cruising on the highway at 80 km/h requires 30 kilowatts to
overcome air drag, that same car will require 240 kilowatts at a speed
of 160 km/h. Thus, a vehicle needs 8 times the engine power to reach
twice the speed. In principle, this means that fuel consumption will
increase fourfold (not eightfold, because the faster vehicle exerts the
power only over half the time).

Over a distance of 1,000 kilometres, the slow car would consume 375
kilowatt-hours (12.5 hours multiplied by 30 kilowatts) and the fast car
would consume 1,500 kilowatt-hours (6.25 hours multiplied by 240
kilowatts).

Speed is the key

However, this extra fuel consumption can be diminished or even negated
by, most importantly, more fuel efficient engines, lighter ~~vehicles~~
materials and better aerodynamics. Even though today's cars are faster
than those from decades ago, they consume [a similar amount of
fuel]({filename}/posts/citroen-2cv.md). This is
the reason why almost everybody is talking about energy efficiency and
aerodynamics, and not about speed.

But if you *lower* the speed, fuel consumption is decreased by the full
75 percent. More efficient technology can not change that – unless in a
positive way. If you combine a lower speed with more fuel efficient
engines and better aerodynamics, fuel savings can become much larger
than 75 percent.

Aerodynamics

Drag can be partly offset by better aerodynamics: a boxy car like the
[Volvo 740](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_740) has a drag area
([drag coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient)
multiplied by frontal area) that is [almost
twice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_drag_coefficient#CdA)
that of the most aerodynamic standard car, the [Honda
Insight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Insight). The Volvo needs
almost two times the engine power of the Honda when driven at 120 km/h.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>

"A boxy car vehicle at 60 km/h will consume much less fuel than the most
aerodynamic vehicle driving at 120 km/h"

</div>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Picture : the [Stanley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Steamer) -
the fastest steamcar ever built.

Yet a Volvo 740 driving at 60 km/h will face less than half the drag and
will need 4.6 times less energy power than a Honda Insight driving at
120 km/h. When compared to velocity, the potential of aerodynamics is
limited.

Moreover, very good aerodynamics is incompatible with high speeds.
Formula 1 racing cars have the worst drag coefficients of all vehicles
on wheels, because of their large spoilers and very wide tyres. At
higher speeds, it becomes important to minimize lift at the expense of
better aerodynamics so that the car is not catapulted into the air.

Low speed trains

The blindness for the importance of speed leads to doubtful conclusions,
like the environmentally friendly label of [high speed
trains]({filename}/posts/planes-on-whe-1.md).
The French TGV that set the most recent speed record at 575 km/h for
wheeled trains in 2007 has an engine output of [19,600
kilowatts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV_world_speed_record#V150_record_train).
A contemporary “slow” train like the [Siemens
ES64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EuroSprinter) with a top speed of 240
km/h has a maximum power output of 6,400 kilowatts.

Travelling 1,000 kilometres, the “slow” train will consume 26,240
kilowatt-hours (over 4.1 hours) while the fast train will consume 33.320
kilowatt-hours (over 1.7 hours). A real slow train ([like this one from
1956](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB_Class_E_41) with a top speed of
120 km/h) would consume only 20,000 kilowatt-hours over the same
trajectory (and would do this in 8.3 hours, comparable to the travel
time of a car).

The French high speed train is definitely more energy efficient than the
Siemens locomotive, and that one is definitely more energy efficient
than the 1956 train, because in both cases power consumption did not
increase exponentially
([\*](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/09/reduce-fuel-consumption-cut-speed.php#comment-218207))
with speed. But that does not take away the fact that the faster trains
consume more energy than the slower trains. If, on the other hand, we
would equip the 1956 train with the energy-efficient technology of
today's high speed train, it would consume much less energy than it did
50 years ago.

Time is money

High speed trains are labelled environmentally friendly because they are
not compared to other trains but to planes (A Boeing 747 would consume
around 65,000 kWh over the same distance, over approximately 1 hour).

In a way this makes sense, because if a passenger prefers the fast train
over the plane, he will consume less energy for a similar trip. He might
not make that choice when the train would be much slower than the plane.
On the other hand, if passengers that normally would take a slow train
[now prefer a fast
train]({filename}/posts/train-travel.md), high
speed trains do raise energy consumption. The problem is that people see
a shorter travel time as an advantage, while it has no ecological value
whatsoever.

You could as well argue that airplanes are green because they consume
less fuel than rockets. This sounds ridiculous now, but [if rocket
planes take off](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7315430.stm),
their inventors will no doubt claim that their toys are environmentally
friendly because they go faster than airplanes but consume less than
rockets. Technology alone can limit the growth of energy consumption,
but if we want to *lower* energy consumption, we have no other choice
but to adapt speed.

Fixation on technology

A decrease of 75 percent in fuel consumption is not peanuts. More than
60 percent of world oil production is used for transportation, which
means that total oil production would be almost halved (-45%). In
combination with more efficient engines, better aerodynamics and lighter
materials a 75 percent reduction of oil production is not unrealistic.

Yet, when the International Energy Agency argues that the average car
sold in 2030 would need to consume 60 percent less fuel than the average
car sold in 2005, it
[claims](http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2007/Fuel_Effi_Road_Info.pdf):
"With current technologies, only plug-in hybrids are capable of this”.
This statement is wrong. We could lower the fuel consumption of cars
(and other vehicles) by at least 75 percent, we could do it today, and
we can do it with present technology.

[Wave drag, sound barrier and hull speed]{#wavedrag}

[]{#wavedrag}
extreme high speeds, the link between velocity and power consumption
becomes even more defined. Here, [wave
drag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_drag) enters the picture and
drag increases more. This is the reason why commercial airplanes never
fly faster than an average speed of about 900 km/h (except for the
retired
[Concorde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde#Environmental_impact)).
If they would go faster than 1.200 km/h, they would break the [sound
barrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_barrier) at the expense of a
massive increase in power consumption.

The [Thrust SCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThrustSSC) (pictured
left), the car that holds the [land speed
record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record) of 1,228 km/h,
and thus broke the sound barrier, consumed 5,500 litres of fuel per 100
kilometres. So even though its speed is only 10 times higher than a
normal car driving the highway, the supersonic car consumes around 550
times more fuel. A picture collection of land speed record vehicles can
be found
[here](http://www.oobject.com/category/most-beautiful-land-speed-record-vehicles/).


When travelling on water, a [similar
effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_making_resistance) comes into
play - albeit at much lower speeds. Every watercraft contains a speed
barrier that is (mainly) dependent on the length of the ship and on the
shape of its bow. This barrier (called the [hull
speed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_speed) in layman's terms) can
be crossed, but only at the expense of another exponential increase in
power consumption.

This is why ships are so much slower than other kinds of transport, and
why [most fast ferries were
retired]({filename}/posts/ocean-liners.md). The
[fastest watercraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_speed_record)
reached a record speed of 511 km/h - not even half that of the fastest
car. Underwater drag is even worse: the speed record of submarines is
only 60 km/h.

[Planes on rails : 10,000 km/h]{#rocketsled}



The [fastest railed
vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_speed_record_for_railed_vehicles)
is not the TGV or the JR-Maglev, but an unmanned [rocket
sled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_sled) that achieved a speed of
more than 10,000 km/h. Rocket sleds are platforms on wheels, propelled
by rockets and used to test missiles or (in earlier times) equipment for
military aircraft. They do not use wheels but sliding pads which prevent
the sled from flying from the track. The fastest manned rocket sled
(pictured above) reached 1,017 km/h.

Some other remarkable manned rail vehicles were the American [Pioneer
Zephyr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Zephyr), the German
[Schienenzeppelin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schienenzeppelin) (which
was powered by an airline propeller at the rear and held the speed
record of 230 km/h for railed vehicles from 1931 to 1954) and the French
[Aérotrain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A9rotrain) (pictured
above, [source](http://trainsdumonde.chez-alice.fr/LA_VITESSE.htm)), a
predecessor of the Japanese Maglev trains.

[Human & wind powered speed records]{#lowtechspeedrecord}



Human and wind powered vehicles are setting new speed records, too. The
fastest human powered watercraft is the
[Decavitator](http://lancet.mit.edu/decavitator/) (with a record speed
of 34.3 km/h), while the fastest wind-powered speed record was set
earlier this year by windsurfer [Antoine
Albeau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Albeau), who reached 90.9
km/h (see picture above, taken from [Masters Of
Speed](http://www.mastersofspeed.com/)). That's only 5 times slower than
the fastest engine powered watercraft. A windsurf board has a much
higher speed barrier since it has [a planing
hull](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_making_resistance#Semi-displacement_and_planing_hulls)
(unfortunately not an option for everyday use, see [this
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIJ1jZQcSSY&feature=related)). See
also:
[Sailrockets](http://www.notechmagazine.com/2009/05/sailing-rockets.html)
& [kiteboats](http://www.notechmagazine.com/2009/04/kiteboating.html).

The speed record of a [pedalled land
vehicle](http://www.gizmag.com/go/5830/) is 86 km/h, that of a [pedal
powered aircraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-powered_aircraft)
32 km/h, and that of a [human powered
submarine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omer_%28submarine%29) 15 km/h
(only 4 times slower than the record speed of an engine powered
submarine). The speed record for [normal
bicycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hour_record) was set at almost 50
km/h (on average during a 1 hour run). The fastest [wind powered
car](http://www.smartplanet.com/news/transport/10001610/photos-greenbird-sail-car-hopes-to-break-wind-record.htm)
does 188 km/h.

Most of these vehicles are not suited for practical use, but that's not
the point. They prove that speed kicks are possible without burning many
barrels of oil. More information at the [Human Powered Vehicle
Association](http://www.hpva.us/).
