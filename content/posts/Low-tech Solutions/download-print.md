Downloading cars, houses and aeroplanes is no science fiction.

In the future, a [desktop
fabricator](http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn10922-desktop-fabricator-may-kickstart-home-revolution.html)
may be as common as a desktop computer today,
[3D-printers](http://www.desktopfactory.com/) might complement inkjet
printers. Downloading, sharing and printing of appliances might become
as ordinary (and controversial) as it is today with music, movies and
texts.

Yet, downloading objects is already possible with a familiar computer
configuration. At least, if the objects are made of paper and if you are
willing to spend some time cutting and pasting. Paper cut-outs have a
[long history](http://www.rigbypapermodels.com/), but thanks to the
internet they are making a comeback.

Using imaging software, the objects can be scaled to your liking. Some
models are very simple and childlike, others are extremely complex and
are rich in detail. They can be surprisingly strong. There are tonnes of
paper models to find – many of them are downloadable for free. An
overview.

1\. Historical paper models

French blog [Agence Eureka](http://bibigreycat.blogspot.com/) has
[several pages of downloadable
cut-outs](http://bibigreycat.blogspot.com/search/label/d%C3%A9coupage)
from far gone times - buildings, soldiers, classic cars, theatre scenes,
farms, a circus, a camping site, and much more. These models used to be
sold as books or printed on food packaging. The high-resolution paper
models are available [at
Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/taffeta/collections/72157613325110693/).





2\. Creatures

Some nice series of cuddlesome creatures: the
[ReadyMechs](http://readymech.fwis.com/), the
[NiceBunnies](http://www.nicebunny.com/downloads/hedkase_paper_galleries.php)
(some of the URL's don't work, find them
[here](http://toysrevil.blogspot.com/2007/07/nicebunnys-free-downloadable-hedkase_25.html))
and the [NaniBirds](http://www.nanibird.com/). It will not take long
before they take over your desk.





3\. Computers & gadgets


has a nice collection of cut-out [computers and
iPods](http://www.theapplecollection.com/Collection/PaperMac/). At last,
you can afford them in any colour you want. More
[iPods](http://homepage.mac.com/colinbaxter/ipod/) can be collected
here. An [iPhone](http://www.buymeaniphone.com/) and an old
[Commodore](http://www.homecomputermuseum.de/comp/14.45_de.htm) computer
are available as well.

Also to be found are two model cameras, a [Nikon
Coolpix](http://www.nikonusa.com/fileuploads/pdfs/origami_042705.pdf)
and a very nice [Pentax
MX](http://stonefield.cocolog-nifty.com/higurashi/2005/09/mx_20e3.html),
as well as a [paper
camera](http://www.pinhole.cz/en/pinholecameras/dirkon_01.html) that
actually works ([more pinhole
cameras]({filename}/posts/camera-obscura.md)).
Collecting this set of [arcade
machines](http://www.wayoftherodent.com/gd101/bs_paperarcade.htm) is
quite addictive, especially in combination with the hooked Barbie dolls.
And check out this
[piano](http://accoutrements.com/actionfigures/piano/) and [drum
set](http://c_hirata.ld.infoseek.co.jp/pastor/omake.html). More geeky
stuff: [games](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/Papercraft/)
[characters](http://cow.mooh.org/paper/), a [vacuum
tube](http://www.cardmodelers.org/DOWNLOAD/tube.pdf), the [Land
IronClad](http://www.currell.net/models/ironclad.htm),
[several](http://www.ninfinger.org/%7Esven/models/papermodels.html)
[spacecraft](http://www.nationaalruimtevaartmuseum.nl/default.htm) and a
model of the [SpaceShip One](http://www.currell.net/models/ss1.htm).

4\. Transportation

The [Paper Bus Connection](http://www.paperbuses.com/) is a catalogue of
paper buses from the US, Canada, China and Hong Kong. Both [Stage Coach
Fan](http://www.geocities.com/stagecoachfan/extras/paperbus/) and
[Greater
London](http://paperbuses.community.fotopic.net/gallery/pwfpaperbuses.fotopic.net/)
have a huge collection of paper buses from the UK. This website has an
overview of
[trams](http://www.tramways.freeserve.co.uk/Tramframe.htm?http://www.tramways.freeserve.co.uk/Models/Makersos/Download.htm).
TGVWeb offers models of [high speed
trains](http://www.trainweb.org/tgvpages/papermodels.html).



We love paper [cars](http://www.hokenstrom.com/cars.html): they don't
pollute, they are silent and they don't drive over children and pets.
The amount of free downloadable cars on the internet is huge - check out
the general sites at the bottom of this page. Some exceptional models
are this very detailed [Volkswagen
bus](http://www.kdf-wagen.de/misc/gen_frame.htm?e?bus_bausatz), this
vintage
[Citroën](http://www.miniatureville.com/get-250dpi/CITROENTUBE-250dpi.jpg),
some [DAF trucks](http://www.daf.com/) (go to 'DAF fun') and a
collection of [classic
cars](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/%7Esd2i-adc/paper2.html) (click on the
Japanese links below). More rolling stock? Here you have a
[snowsweeper](http://www.oharacorp.co.jp/pc/df/pcdl.html), a
[motorcycle](http://www.yamaha-motor.co.jp/global/entertainment/papercraft/index.html)
or a [work
truck](http://www.sakainet.co.jp/japanese/playland/index.html).

They don't float for long, but they sure look nice: paper ships are
among the [most detailed](http://www.bildrum.se/papership.htm) cut-outs
around - though most of them are not for free. Here you find some nice
free downloadable card models from
[warships](http://www.digitalnavy.com/html/downloads.html),
[sailing](http://www.byyb.org/byyb/model/index.html)
[boats](http://membres.lycos.fr/egoist/common/paperego/paperego.htm),
[cargo ships](http://www.nykline.co.jp/kids/papercraft/) and
[hovercrafts](http://www.geocities.com/srn6hovercraft/More_Papermodels.html).
There are also dozens of [plane
models](http://www.ss42.com/pt-planemodel.html) available.5. General
sites


There are several websites that collect all kinds of paper models, some
of them are updated frequently.
[Spacestation42](http://www.ss42.com/toys.html) seems to be the best one
at the moment. Also [3Dpapermodel](http://www.3dpapermodel.com.tw/) has
a very nice collection, but the site is mainly in Japanese.
[Papertoys](http://papertoys.com/) is another place to go.
[Canon](http://cp.c-ij.com/europe/papercraft/nl/) has quite some
cut-outs available. [Card
Modellers](http://www.cardmodelers.org/index.html),
[Paperforest](http://paperforest.blogspot.com/) and [Free Paper
Toys](http://www.freepapertoys.com/) bring news and information on paper
models.

All models mentioned above are free to download. Other websites offer
cut-outs that need to be paid. Examples are
[Fiddlersgreen](http://www.fiddlersgreen.net/),
[Papermodels](http://www.papermodels.net/new.html), [Hobby
Factory](http://www.hobbyfactory.com/) and [Instant
Durable](http://www.instantdurable.com/accueil/accueil_franglais_menu.htm).
Most commercial cut-outs can be downloaded, others are sent by post.

Micromodels, cut-outs that were very popular from the 40s to the 60s,
are again for sale on the internet
([US](http://www.micromodelsusa.com/),
[UK](http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/jcoweb/micromodels/)). The downloads are
much cheaper than the (rare) originals, but unfortunately still quite
expensive.

1\. It turns out that [Creative
Closeup](http://www.creativecloseup.com/100-exceptional-free-paper-models-and-toys)
published a similar article like this, some days earlier. They have some
extra models that we missed.

2\. [The Toymaker](http://www.thetoymaker.com/) has folding paper toys
for kids

3\. The Bryn Mawr College has an exciting collection of [19th century
panorama paintings and
drawings](http://www.brynmawr.edu/iconog/inven2.html) from Philadelphia.
These were never meant as paper models, but they're great for building a
wall-to-wall paper city.



4\. This Russian site has [387 paper
models](http://mm-archive.narod.ru/list.htm), mostly planes, ships, cars
and buildings - and quite some military stuff, too. Only the older
(antique) models are free to download, but there are still enough of
them to keep you busy for a very long time. The cut-outs (from the 60s
and the 70s) are of an exceptional quality. Via [Agence
Eureka](http://bibigreycat.blogspot.com/2008/04/387-maquettes-de-1957-1993-les-modles.html)[.](http://www.slurf.be/)



5\. [Tatebanko](http://tatebanko.com/) is a Japanese paper art of
creating dioramas from paper. It was popular from the 17th century to
the early 20th century. The site shows some inspirational details of how
they can be made.



6\. Build your own [paper
rocket](http://www.groeg.de/puzzles/rocket.html) (Via
