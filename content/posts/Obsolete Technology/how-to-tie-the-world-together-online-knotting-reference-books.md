The sheer number and diversity of knots that was once in use would be
bewildering to the modern city-dweller. About 4,000 different knots are
described, ranging from the very simple to the extremely complex.

Not so long ago, each profession or trade had adopted the knots best
suited to its requirements, and knotting was part of their daily lives.
There are some good knotting reference books available online, and all
of them are older than most of us.



Knots can be subdivided according to their general purpose: to attach a
rope to another rope (fastening knots), to attach a rope to an object
(hitches), to shorten a rope without cutting it (shortening knots), to
form an enlarged end on a rope (ending knots), or to attach two rope
ends together in such a way that they represent a smooth and even
surface (splices).

In addition to these practical knots, there are many kinds of fancy
knots used in ornamenting the ends of ropes, decorating shrouds of
vessels, railing and similar objects (which will not be covered
here).Below I will outline some basic knots and highlight remarkable
examples of this technology.

Basic knot technology


Desirable features of most knots are that they may be quickly tied,
easily untied and will not slip under strain. A number of terms are
generally used when tying knots. The "standing" part of a knot is the
principal portion, or longest part of the rope.

The "bight" is the curved part, looped or bent while working or handling
the rope in making the knot, and the "end" is that part used in forming
the knot or hitch (illustration above, left). All knots are begun by
loops or rings known to mariners as "cuckolds' necks" (illustration
above, right). These may be overhand or underhand. If the loose end of
the rope is passed over the standing part and through the cuckold's
neck, the simplest of all knots, known as the "overhand knot" is made
(illustration on the 

This is the knot that everybody can make. I hope that my readers are
more knot-savvy than me, but I have to confess that it is the only one
that I am able to make, when I tie my shoelaces.

Fastening knots


a bit more sophistication, much better knots can be made. The "figure
eight knot" (commonly used to prevent a rope from running through an eye
or ring or tackle block) is almost as simple as the overhand knot, and
only a step beyond this is the "square knot", which is one of the best
all-round knots known (above, left). It is very strong, never slips or
becomes jammed when being strained, and is readily untied. Beware of the
"granny knot", though, which looks very similar but is utterly useless.
In spite of its versatility, however, the "square knot" is not always
ideal.


For example, it is not reliable when joining two ropes of unequal size
together, because they will slip. In this case, the "open-hand knot" can
be used (illustration on the right). In joining small lines, the
"weaver's knot" is the best option, while the "fisherman's knot" is
valuable when it is important that the two lines may be drawn apart with
just one pull.

The "hawser knot" is the best to use when joining two stiff and heavy
ropes and the "bowline knot" comes in handy to tie a horse or cow so
that they will not choke themselves. For every possible application, our
forefathers seem to have developed a suitable knot. Tools to be used in
tandem with knots also exist: in a number of cases a toggle is used
either to aid in making the knot or make it easier to untie it after a
strain has been applied (illustration on the left, applied to a
decorative knot called the "monkey chain").


Two distinct types of fastening knots are "ending knots" and "shortening
knots". Ending knots prevent the rope from unravelling - some form of an
"artificial eye" is one way to do that (illustration on the right).
Shortening knots are useful when the rope is too long and where it is
awkward to have the free ends hanging loose, or where the ends are in
use and the slack must be taken up in the middle of the rope. Both types
come in a wide variety and are also used extensively for their
ornamental value.

Splices


Thanks to knots, ropes can be made as long as you please - regardless of
the length of the
[ropewalk]({filename}/posts/lost-knowledge-ropes-and-knots.md).
However, many times it is necessary to join two ends together in such a
way that the union is as strong as the rest of the rope and still not
too large and irregular to pass through a hole or pulley block.

The method of joining two ropes to meet the above requirements is called
splicing. There are two general types of rope splices, known as the
short splice and the long splice. The long splice is preferable since it
is stronger and does not increase the volume of the rope at all. A
well-made long splice cannot be distinguished from the rope itself after
a few days use. Splices can also be applied to steel "wire ropes"
(below).



Hitches


When fastening a rope to a stationary or solid object, instead of
fastening rope ends together, another class of knots used are called
"hitches".


the diversity of hitches is overwhelming, with each knot designed to
meet some special requirements. Some are designed for fastenings where
the pull is continuous, others were invented to hold without slipping on
wet timber, and others serve extremely well when a knot should be easily
untied. The pro's and con's of specific hitches can be crucial knowledge
in pertinent situations. The "blackwall hitch", for example, has the
interesting property that it holds more securely the greater the strain
is, but it is unreliable if the rope is slack.


Other hitches are especially designed for certain objects. The "catspaw"
(illustration on the left) is useful for hoisting with a hook. Others
are suitable to hoist an open barrel ("sling for a cask"), and others
are used in hoisting pipe, where no special clamp is available for
attaching the hoisting tackle to the pipe ("pipe hitch").

Handcuffs


There are hitches designed for attaching a rope to a ring, hitches used
in tying up light packages, or hitches invented to form a seat for men
to be lowered over cliffs or buildings. Many hitches will pull tighter
the harder the strain, and are still easy to untie. The "tomfool knot"
(illustration on the left) is used as a pair of very secure handcuffs.
One of the most high-tech knots around is the "[diamond
hitch](http://www.notechmagazine.com/2010/03/diamond-hitch-manual-for-pack-animals-.html)",
used to tie loads to pack animals. Full instructions of it can be found
in this [1916

[Lost knowledge: ropes and
knots]({filename}/posts/lost-knowledge-ropes-and-knots.md)
They are among the most ancient and useful technologies ever developed
by man, predating the wheel, the axe and probably also the use of fire.
Today, ropes and knots are fast on their way to become an obsolete
technology.




[Aerial Ropeways: automatic cargo transport for a
bargain]({filename}/posts/aerial-ropeways-automatic-cargo-transport.md)
These days, we use them almost exclusively to transport skiers and
snowboarders up snow slopes, but before the 1940s, aerial ropeways were
a common means of cargo transport, not only in mountainous regions but
also on flat terrain, with large-scale systems already built during the
Middle Ages. Cargo tramways can be fully or partly powered by gravity,
and some deliver excess power that can be utilized to generate
electricity or to drive cranes or machinery in nearby factories. Some
innovative systems have been constructed in recent years.




[Human powered cranes and lifting
devices]({filename}/posts/history-of-human-powered-cranes.md)
From the earliest civilisations right up to the start of the Industrial
Revolution, humans used sheer muscle power, organisation skills and
ingenious mechanics to lift weights that would be impossible to handle
by most power cranes in operation today.



[The art of producing sustainable consumer goods:
basketry]({filename}/posts/basketry-the-art-of-producing-sustainable-consumer-goods.md)
The craft of basketry might be one of our species’ most important and
diverse technologies, creating homes, boats, animal traps, armour,
tools, cages, hats, chariots, weirs, beehives, shelters and furniture,
as well as all manner of containers. Basket weaving makes use of
fast-growing biodegradable materials&mdash;branches, twigs or shoots --
that requires the forest to be cultivated rather than cleared. Basketry
allows almost anyone, with little or no money and few tools, to create a
large variety of useful goods in a way that is one hundred percent
sustainable.
