Ever since the arrival of fossil fuels and electricity, human powered
tools and machines have been viewed as an obsolete technology. This
makes it easy to forget that there has been a great deal of progress in
their design, largely improving their productivity.

The most efficient mechanism to harvest human energy appeared in the
late 19th century: pedalling. Stationary pedal powered machines went
through a boom at the turn of the 20th century, but the arrival of cheap
electricity and fossil fuels abruptly stopped all further development.

Hand cranks, capstans & treadwheels

Rotary motion has been the fundamental mechanism of most machines
throughout human history. There have been several important innovations
in applying human power to rotary motion, many of which already appeared
in Antiquity: the bow (see the article on [human powered drilling
tools]({filename}/posts/hand-powered-drilling-tools-and-machines.md)),
the hand crank, the capstan and the treadwheel (these are described in
more detail in the article on [human powered
cranes]({filename}/posts/history-of-human-powered-cranes.md)).
Successively, each of these brought an improved mechanical advantage,
being the factor by which the mechanism multiplied the human (or
sometimes animal) input force into an higher output force.

A hand crank had a mechanical advantage of about 2 to 1, meaning that
the mechanism doubled the effort of the user. With a capstan, the
mechanical advantage went up to about 6 to 1. A typical treadwheel,
which had a diameter of at least 4 metres, had a mechanical advantage of
about 14 to 1. This meant that a person walking a treadwheel could exert
7 times more 'torque' (the force to rotate an object about an axis) than
a person operating a hand crank. Or, that a person could generate the
same amount of torque with 7 times less effort.


The treadwheel had another advantage over the hand crank: it replaced
the use of the arm muscles by the use of the much stronger leg muscles,
and it allowed the use of two limbs instead of one. The same effort
could thus be sustained over a longer time - or a higher force could be
exerted over the same time. To a lesser extent, the same advantage was
valid for the capstan, where the legs did a large part of the work.



Another novelty appeared in the Middle Ages: the treadle. From the 10th
century onwards, the Chinese used wooden treadles to obtain continuous
motion for water pumps, textile machinery and wood saws. In the western
world, treadles were mainly applied to spinning wheels and lathes
(machine tools used for working metal and wood).

Treadles were inefficient compared to capstans and treadwheels (feet and
legs must be accelerated and subsequently decelerated by the muscles)
but they were more compact and a viable alternative when power
requirements were low. Their main advantage over the hand crank was that
they left both hands free to control the machine.

A boom of pedal powered machines


cleverest innovation in applying human power to rotary motion only
appeared in the 1870s. Some of us still use it as a means of
transportation, but it is rarely applied to stationary machines anymore:
pedal power. Initially, pedals and cranks were connected directly to the
front (or sometimes rear) wheel. With the arrival of the 'safety
bicycle' shortly afterwards, this direct power transmission was replaced
by a chain drive and sprockets - still the basics of most present-day
bicycles. Pedal power did not come out of the blue: some of the first
bicycles were equipped with treadles, which could be considered the
predecessor of the pedal.


their own, pedals and cranks did not offer a better mechanical advantage
than the hand crank, let alone the capstan or the treadwheel. What made
pedal power so revolutionary was that it offered the possibility to use
the stronger leg muscles in a continuous motion while at the same time
offering a much more compact mechanism than the capstan or the
treadwheel.

Moreover, using the appropriate gear ratio (using chains and sprockets
of different sizes) a mechanical advantage similar to that of a capstan
or a treadwheel could be achieved (multiplying torque at the expense of
speed or vice versa). This made pedal power suitable for a much larger
variety of applications.


1876 onwards, pedals and cranks were attached to tools like lathes,
saws, grinders, shapers, tool sharpeners and to boring, drilling and
cutting machines. These machines - which became very popular - were
intended for small workshops and households without electricity or steam
power. They were made with heavy cast-iron bodies that could be
collapsed for shipping.

Pedals and cranks did not make treadles and hand cranks obsolete. On the
contrary, these tools became more sophisticated (made of steel instead
of wood, for example, or using gears inspired by bicycles) and became
increasingly popular for low or brief power applications.


treadles were applied to industrial machines like hat, broom, cigar and
hook making machines, printing presses, punch machines and riveting
machines. The farm saw the appearance of foot powered harvesters,
treshers, milking machines and vegetable bundlers. The late 19th century
dentist used a [treadle powered
drill](http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/256743/dental-drill-pedal-operated-circa-1910).

Ending human drudgery

The historical importance of pedal powered machines can be easily
overlooked by people who grew accustomed to fossil fuels and ubiquitous
electricity. Therefore, it cannot be stressed enough how much of an
improvement pedal power was in the light of thousands of years of human
drudgery. Pedals and cranks make use of human power in a near-optimum
way.


The circular pedalling motion mainly activates the thigh muscles or
quadriceps which are the largest and most powerful muscles in the human
body. Furthermore, using the appropriate gearing, pedals and cranks make
use of these muscles at an optimal speed: about 60 to 90 revolutions per
minute. Research in the twentieth century has shown that muscles develop
maximum power when they are contracting quickly against a small
resistance.

Historically, the motions used to harvest human muscle power used
inappropriate muscles moving against resistances which were too large at
speeds which were too low. While human powered capstans and treadwheels
were much more efficient, their use was limited because of their sheer
size (and especially in the case of treadwheels, their high costs).

In the 1977 book [Pedal Power in Work, Leisure and
Transportation](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0878571787/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lowtemagaz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0878571787)',
David Wilson explains three ways in which the application of human
muscle power could fall short of the optimum:

"First, the wrong muscles could be involved. We find time and time again
that people were called upon to produce maximum power output, for
instance in pumping or lifting water from a well or ditch, using only
their arm and back muscles. Second, the speed of the muscle motion was
usually far too low. People were required to heave and shove with all
their might, gaining an occasional inch or two. A modern parallel would
be to force bicyclists to pedal up the steepest hills in the highest
gears, or to require oarsmen to row boats with very long oars having
very short inboard handles. Third, the type of motion itself, even if
carried out at the best speed using the leg muscles, could be nonoptimum
in a rather abstruse way."


Good examples of the misuse of human muscle power throughout history
were large human powered rowing boats, as well as most farm work. In the
third edition of '[Bicycling
Science](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262731541/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=lowtemagaz-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=0262731541)',
the same David Wilson writes:

"The muscle actions used by these unfortunate oarsmen were typical of
those considered appropriate in the ancient world. The hand, arm and
back muscles were used the most, while the largest muscles in the body -
those in the legs - were used merely to provide props or reaction
forces. (They didn't have the sliding seat of today's competitive
rowers). The motion was generally one of straining mightily against a
slowly yielding resistance. With five men on the inboard end of a sweep,
the one at the extreme end would have a more rapid motion than the one
nearest to the pivot, but even the end man would probably be working at
well below his optimum speed. Most farm work and forestry fell into the
same general category. Hoeing, digging, sawing, chopping, pitchforking,
and shoveling all used predominantly the arm and back muscles with
little useful output from the leg muscles. In many cases, the muscles
had to strain against stiff resistances."


Pedal power is a product of the industrial revolution

All these actions - and many more - could have been made much more
efficient using pedals and cranks, making the life of people in
Antiquity and medieval times much easier. However, no matter how simple
it seems to us today, pedal power could not have appeared earlier in
history. Pedals and cranks are products of the industrial revolution,
made possible by the combination of cheap steel (itself a product of
fossil fuels) and mass production techniques, resulting in strong yet
compact sprockets, chains, ball bearings and other metal parts.

Prior to that time, the available materials were not strong enough to
take the large force that was acted upon them. This is even truer for
stationary pedal power than for road bicycles, because the strain on
parts is considerably larger. Experiments in the 1970s designing pedals,
cranks and bearings for stationary pedal power units using
pre-industrial materials like wood failed. And while the frame of a
pedal powered machine can be made of wood or bamboo, steel is a better
option - contrary to road bicycles, a lightweight frame is not an
advantage for a stationary machine.


It is important to realise that pedal powered machines (and bicycles)
require fossil fuels. If we burn up all fossil fuels driving cars, we
won't be able to revert to bicycles, we will have to walk. If we burn up
all fossil fuels making electricity to drive our appliances, we won't be
able to revert to pedal powered machines, but to the drudgery that went
before them.

And yet, this is what we are heading to. In spite of the many advantages
of pedals and cranks, the heydays of pedal power were over fast -
shortly after the arrival of the combustion engine and the electric
motor. Even though pedal powered machines were designed to operate for
100 years or more, most were scrapped for metal during World War One &
Two. The [Barnes
Company](http://americanartifacts.com/smma/barnes/barnes.htm), one of
the most famous manufacturers, began turning away from foot powered
tools in the 1920s and stopped producing them altogether in 1937.



The revival of pedal powered machines

Pedal powered machines resurged in the 1970s, together with the bicycle,
following the first oil crisis (the pedal powered gas pump being an
iconic example). Because the further development of stationary pedal
powered machines had been halted for more than 5 decades, there was a
lot of work ahead in order to modernize the technology.

Several individuals and organisations experimented with a new generation
of pedal powered machines. Although their efforts did not result in
commercially available machines, a great deal of progress was made. The
applications of pedal power were extended to include almost every
possible machine. Moreover, several inventors designed and build
universal pedal power units, which could be used to drive a wide range
of tools and machines ([see part 3: "Pedal powered farms and factories:
the forgotten future of the stationary
bicycle"]({filename}/posts/pedal-powered-farms-and-factories.md)).


Unfortunately, the interest in pedal powered machines waned again after
the oil crisis, largely halting research for another two decades. The
second revival of pedal powered machines began halfway the 1990s when
concerns over global warming and peak oil came to the fore, and
continues today.

However, the present interest in stationary pedal power differs
considerably from all earlier efforts: it is largely aimed at generating
electricity, which is not an efficient way to harness pedal power.
Furthermore, the lessons learned during the late 1800s and during the
1970s seem to have been forgotten, resulting in far from optimal
machines that do not harvest the full potential of pedal power and -
worse - have a doubtful ecological advantage ([see part 2: "Bike powered
electricity generators are not
sustainable"]({filename}/posts/bike-powered-electricity-generators.md)).
