Cable trains (or funiculars) are one of the most energy-efficient modes
of transport out there.

A large portion of the power required to pull up the ascending car is
delivered by the counterweight of the descending car.

Many historical systems used this efficiency and took it one step
further with systems exclusively powered by water and gravity.


Cable trains first appeared within the second half of the 19th century.
Many of them [have survived and continue to be
utilised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funicular) (mostly in a
modernized form) and new systems are being developed. A cable train
system is operated on a steep slope with a gradient of up to 55 percent
and consists of two passenger cars which are connected by a steel cable.
Both cars travel on the same single track, which is undoubled in the
middle so that they can pass each other.



Cable trains prove extremely energy efficient because a large share of
the power required to pull up the ascending car is delivered by the
counterweight of the descending car. Since the system only needs one
track and can go straight up a mountain, it also saves a lot of
materials and space (some systems use two tracks but follow the [same
principle](http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Datei:Schema-Wasserballastbahnen.png&filetimestamp=20060418180532)).
A funicular should not be confused with a cog wheel train - even though
many older cable cars applied a similar mechanism, as a braking system
and speed governor, not as a traction method.

Water powered cable trains

Originally, cable train systems were even more energy-efficient than
they are today. Instead of using an engine to pull the cable, the extra
power required to overcome friction and to pull up the ascending car was
delivered by filling the water reservoir of the upper car (see an
example of the mechanism below).



Before departure, the employee in the upper station was informed of the
number of passengers that had entered the ascending car. He then knew
exactly how much water the reservoir of the descending car should
contain (around 80 litres per passenger).

From the moment the descending car became heavier than the ascending
car, the brakes were loosened and both cars were set in motion powered
solely by gravity. Once the descending car arrived, its water reservoir
was emptied and the process was repeated.

Most cable trains using water counterbalanced energy have been replaced
by systems that utilise engines. One famous example is the [Funiculaire
de Montmartre in Paris,
France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmartre_funicular), which was
operated by water power from 1900 to 1930 and transported one million
passengers per year (illustration below).



Thankfully, a few water powered cable cars continue to be in service,
and have remained so for over a century. The [Elevador do Bom Jesus in
Braga, Portugal](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevador_do_Bom_Jesus),
has been in use since 1882. The [Nerobergbahn in Wiesbaden,
Germany](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerobergbahn), has been working
since 1888, the [Lynton & Lynmouth in North Devon,
UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynton_and_Lynmouth_Cliff_Railway)
since 1890, and the [Funiculaire Neuveville-St.Pierre in Fribourg,
Switzerland](http://www.funimag.com/funimag08/FRIBURG2.HTM) since 1899
(see [picture](http://www.seilbahn-nostalgie.ch/fribourg.html) intro,
note the water filling system on the side of the car).

Perpetuum mobile

Most water powered cable cars require energy to operate the pump that
transports the water up the hill again, so of course, perpetual motion
does not exist. There are however some exceptions to this. The 120 metre
track in Fribourg, Switzerland, [operates without a
pump](http://www.lagruyere.ch/archives/2003/03.08.02/fribourg.htm). It
makes use of the natural flow of water along the track, more
specifically the waste water infrastructure which connects the upper and
the lower part of town.



How it works is this (illustration above,
[source](http://www.funimag.com/funimag08/FRIBURG2.HTM)): The waste
water flows into a reservoir of 100,000 litres. From there it flows in
the water tank of the rail car . Around 1,500 litres of water is
required to pull up the other car from 60 meters below, and it takes 3
minutes to fill up the tank. After approximately 1.5 minutes, you will
have arrived at the ground station. The reservoir is then emptied and
the water continues its way downwards through the sewer system. The
train route was designed as a (very creative) way to lower the flow of
the fountains in the lower part of town.

Gravity

To add to this, in the case of the Lynton & Lynmouth Cliff Railway, no
water is pumped from the bottom to fill the tanks at the top station -
the water is taken from a nearby river. Moreover, at this track the
method is reversed. Both car tanks are full of water, the tank of the
bottom car is partially discharged until the bottom car becomes lighter
than the top car, and gravity takes its course ([source & more
info](http://www.funimag.com/funimag19/Lynton04.htm)). The Centre for
Alternative Technology built a [similar
system](http://www.cat.org.uk/visitus/vc_content.tmpl?subdir=visitus&sku=VC_02/03)
in 1992 with a lake at the top of the mountain supplying the railway
with water.



The main disadvantage of a water-balanced railway (just like any other
use of hydro power) is that it cannot be operated when the water freezes
over. Bummer.

You need a mountain as well, of course.
