For almost every electronic device or oil driven machine there used to
be a low-tech alternative that was powered by human muscles, water or
wind. The [Museum of Old
Techniques](http://www.mot.be/en/ "Museum of Old Techniques") aims to
collect and study these historical alternatives to modern day machinery.
Why, you may ask?

To quote the Museum: "Evolution doesn't necessarily mean progress, what
we consider to be primitive solutions are often not primitive at all".
We could not have said it better ourselves. The website of the MOT
contains, among other things, some [2,000 simple drawings of hand
tools](http://www.mot.be/en/opzoeken/iddoc) (ordered by shape, and [by
profession](http://www.mot.be/en/opzoeken/iddoc/algemeen)) and a
collection of illustrated [trade
catalogues](http://www.mot.be/en/opzoeken/rcb) (up until 1950, in
French).


A somewhat related publication is Edward H. Knightâ€™s [American
Mechanical Dictionary
(1881)](http://www.princetonimaging.com/library/mechanical-dictionary/)
: an almost 3,000 page encyclopedia with descriptions and illustrations
of tools, instruments, machines, processes and engineering dating from
the 19th century. You need to download a plugin to see the scans.

Knight's book contains not only early electric equipment and steam
driven machinery, but also human and animal powered machines. The site
is also host to a 1,500 page [Western Electric Catalog dating from
1916](http://www.princetonimaging.com/library/western_electric_catalog_1916/),
describing and picturing electric equipment on sale at the time.
