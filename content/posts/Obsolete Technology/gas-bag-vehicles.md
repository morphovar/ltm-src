gas cars]({filename}/posts/wood-gas-cars.md)
were not the only answer to the limited supply of gasoline in World War
One and Two. An even more cumbersome alternative came in the form of the
gas bag vehicle.

The old-timers on these pictures are not moving furniture or an
oversized load. What can be seen on the roof is the fuel tank of the
vehicle - a balloon filled with uncompressed gas.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gas bag vehicles were built during World War One and (especially) World
War Two in France, the Netherlands, Germany and England as an improvised
solution to the shortage of gasoline. Apart from automobiles, buses and
trucks were also equipped with the technology. The vehicles consumed
'town gas' or 'street gas', a by-product of the process of turning coal
into cokes (which are used to make iron).





Today, vehicles powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) are quite practical. The fuel tank needs to be
roughly twice as big as a gasoline fuel tank in order to get the same
range. But the fuel used for gas bag vehicles during the World Wars was
generally not compressed and had a much lower energy density than LPG or
CNG. To replace one litre of gasoline, two to three cubic metres of gas
was needed.



The only way to get a somewhat practical range, was to use an extremely
large 'fuel tank'. Buses were better suited for this than automobiles -
they had a full-length gas storage bag on a roof rack. It could be
enclosed in a streamlined fairing but most often it was not.





Private automobiles were equipped with a wooden framework which was
fastened to the roof and the reinforced bumpers of the vehicle. It was
hard to overlook a gas bag vehicle passing along.





The Dutch old-timer on the pictures above carried a gas storage bag of
13 cubic metres, an installation that gave it a range of approximately
50 km (30 miles) at an energy consumption of 13 litres per km (22 mpg).
The aerodynamics of gas bag automobiles were disastrous, so fuel economy
was far from optimal.



Easy repair

Witnesses to the vehicle passing by could easily see how much fuel was
left: the gas bag was fully inflated at the start of a trip, and it
deflated with every mile that was driven.





The gas storage bags were made of silk or other fabrics, soaked in
rubber (Zodiac was one of the manufacturers). These bags were (and are)
much cheaper and easier to build than metal tanks. They could also be
repaired in a similar way to bicycle tyres. The bag was anchored to the
roof using rings and straps. Some gas bag vehicles could operate
alternatively on gas or gasoline. Switching between the two options
could be controlled from inside the vehicle.

Compressed gas

Although it was technically possible to compress town gas or street gas,
this did not happen because of two reasons. Carbon monoxide, one of the
components of town gas and street gas, disintegrates quickly when
compressed, while hydrogen gas, another component, leaks away through
steel tanks when it is compressed.



The only exception was the use of [gas
cylinders](http://www.citroenmodelcars.nl/html/gallerytractiongaz.htm)
in France during World War Two (picture above), allowing for a smaller
fuel tank or a better range. Natural gas was used in this case, which
could be compressed without the drawbacks of compressing town gas.
However, this configuration turned out to be more expensive and more
dangerous.

No smoking



It will not surprise anyone that gas bag vehicles had their risks. One
obvious risk was fire, which could cause a gas explosion. As a result,
people waiting for the bus were urged not to smoke (See pictures:
"Autobus-Haltestelle" = "bus stop" & "Rauchen verboten" = "smoking
prohibited").

Bridges

Another risk were bridges and other overhead obstacles. The driver
needed to know the exact height of his vehicle and of the bridges that
he planned to drive underneath.

Excessive speeds were not a good idea either. It was advised not to
surpass a speed of 50 km/h (30 mph), not only to maintain a decent range
but also to make sure that the fuel tank would not fly off the vehicle.
Strong side winds could present hazardous situations, too. Gas bag
vehicles also suffered from carburator fires, loud bangs and engine
damage.



Gas bag buses could still be seen in China [in the
1990s](http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Excursions-2/Zigong-gas-bus.html),
notably in the municipality of Chongqing where they were developed in
peace time as a cheap public transportation option. The picture below
([credit](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wurui0903/)) shows at least six
operating gas bag buses in Shawan ("Sandy Bay"), Shandong, China, in
1965.
