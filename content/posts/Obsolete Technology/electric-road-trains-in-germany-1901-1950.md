engineer Max Schiemann was among the first engineers to develop a
commercial trolleybus system for passengers at the turn of the 20th
century. He also created some unique cargo systems.

  

1\. Hafenschleppbahn in Altona (1912-1950)

The most succesfull (and most remarkable) trolleytruck network designed
and constructed by Schiemann was the
"[Hafenschleppbahn](http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,3950299,3950299#msg-3950299)"
in Altona, today an area in Hamburg. The road from the port to the town
was so steep that horses had severe difficulty climbing it. Trolleytruck
technology came to the rescue, but the electric trucks on the one
kilometre long track (up and down) did not replace the horses.

The trucks were used as an assisting power source. As can be seen on the
pictures below, the trolleytruck pushed or pulled one or more horse
cars, while other wagons (handcarts included) were also attached to the
convoy. (The guy on the
[bike]({filename}/posts/get-rid-of-cars-ride-a-bicycle.md)
is not).


This hybrid system combining electricity with animal and human power
started operation in 1912 and remained in service until 1950. Each day,
around 200 wagons were pulled or pushed up the hill, each convoy
transporting 5 to 7 tonnes of cargo. In the first ten months of its
existence, the road trains took more than 22,000 wagons up the hill.
Total electricity consumption during that period was 30,878
kilowatt-hours.


The maximum speed of the trolleytrucks was 10 kilometres per hour while
climbing the hill and 30 kilometres per hour on flat terrain. The
average speed of the convoy was 5 to 8 kilometres per hour and the trip
up the hill took 8 minutes, coupling and uncoupling included. In total
six trucks were used, several of them at the same time (two trucks
crossing posed no problem since the one coming down was not connected to
the overhead line).


Fees were collected during the trip. The service was initially exploited
by the "Gesellschaft für gleislose Bahnen Max Schiemann & Co.", from
1922 it was run by the town of Altona, and later by the city of Hamburg.



2\. Bielatal Bahn (1901-1904) & Industriebahn Wurzen (1905-1928)

The first system built by Schiemann and his "Geselschaft für gleislose
Bahnen Max Schiemann & Co." was the
"[Bielatalbahn](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielatalbahn_%28Oberleitungsbus%29)",
a 2.8 kilometre long track in Sachsen. It carried both passengers and
cargo (mainly for a paper factory). The track operated only from 1901 to
1904, but the infrastructure was reused to build (part of) a new line
close to Leipzig: the "[Industriebahn
Wurzen](http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,3957677)", an
exclusive cargo line which was in operation from 1905 until 1928.

It was 3.46 kilometres long (4.23 kilometres up to 1914, when an extra
track was in use). The cargo system consisted of 2 trolleytrucks, 10
wagons for coal transport (each with a capacity of 6 tons) and 27 wagons
for flour transport (each with a capacity of 5 tons). Each truck had a
power output of 25 HP and could pull a maximum of 3 wagons with a total
weight of 15 tonnes (comparable to this [contemporary
truck](http://www.sandandstone.co.za/images/truck-3acle.jpg)).


The speed of the road train was 6 kilometres per hour when loaded and 8
kilometres per hour when unloaded. The trolleytrucks were initially
equipped with wood and iron wheels with spokes, only later to be
replaced by rubber tyres. The same trucks were used for the full 23
years, accidents did not occur.



The line was constructed to transport flour from a flour mill to the
cargo train station. An extra track carried coal from a mine to the
station, but was closed when the mine shut down in 1914. On average, 300
tons of cargo was transported each day. Planned extensions to a
wallpaper factory and a felt factory were never realised.


Since the production facilities of Schiemann were located in the same
town, the track was also used to test vehicles and convoys for other
lines. Allegedly, the owner of the flour mill also had a small private
passenger vehicle for use on the line.

3\. Kalkbahn Grevenbrücker (1903-1907)

The first trolleyline built exclusively for cargo (the
"[Kalkbahn](http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,3926640)")
was installed in Grevenbrück, a village in the present-day municipality
of Lennestadt in Nordrhein-Westfalen. The 1.5 kilometre trajectory
served to transport limestone from a quarry (opened in 1902) to the
train station. The route went straight through the town and crossed an
old bridge. The line opened in 1903 and was closed in 1907, when the
quarry was relocated. The service was operated by the mining company
itself, the "Grevenbrücker Kalkwerke".


About 20 convoys passed each day, at a speed of 6 kilometres per hour
(loaded) or 7 to 8 kilometres an hour (unloaded). The trucks could pull
3 to 4 wagons (each with a capacity of 5 to 6 tonnes) in good weather
conditions, and 2 wagons when there was ice or snow.



In winter, the trolleytrucks were equipped with snow tyres (above). For
the same reason, the wagons on the first Schiemann system (the
Bielatalbahn described above) were equipped with skates.

The trolleytruck was also used to pull a rolling mill for road building
(below). The "Kalkbahn" was built in just 3 months. Financial savings
were about 33 percent compared to the same trajectory by horse cart.


The town of Grevenbüch also had a second line, the "[Veischedetal
Bahn](http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,3926640)"
(scroll down), which was in operation from 1904 to 1916. Until 1907 it
transported both passengers and goods (mainly tobacco to some cigar
factories), after that date it carried only passengers and mail. The
route was 8 kilometres long and the vehicles attained a speed of 18
km/h. Both trolley lines came together at the train station, but they
were not interconnected.

4\. Other Schiemann trolley lines

Max Schieman built 12 lines in total: several passenger trolley lines as
well as some more routes that were used to transport both passengers and
cargo. The "[Gleislose Bahn
Blankenese-Marienhöhe](http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,3950299,3950299#msg-3950299)"
(below) had a length of 3 kilometres and carried passengers between the
train station and the town. It was in operation from 1911 to 1915. The
passenger line "[Gleislose Bahn
Ahrweiler](http://www.drehscheibe-foren.de/foren/read.php?17,3922308)"
was in operation from 1906 to 1917 and had a length of 5.5 kilometres.

The 4.5 kilometres long "[Gleislose Bahn
Monheim-Langenfeld](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleislose_Bahn_Monheim%E2%80%93Langenfeld)"
transported both goods (5,000 tonnes per year), passengers and mail. It
was in operation from 1904 to 1908 and was the only line that was
discontinued because of technical problems - the trucks were too heavy
and damaged the road.


Contemporaries of Schiemann, building or experimenting with trolleytruck
systems, were [Werner von Siemens, Lombard Und Guérin (France), Carl
Stoll, Charles Nithard (France), E.Cantono (Italy), Hans-Ludwig Stoll
and
Lloyd-Köhler](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberleitungsbus#Geschichte).
World War I slowed down the further development of trolley systems, and
it was only in the 1930s that the technology really took off. Only for
passengers, though, since cargo systems never became widespread.
